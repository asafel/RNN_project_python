It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love your love protects my fears
And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold
Did you paint your smile on, well I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove
If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Well I know he's not old 
And I'm told he's a virgin
For he may be she
But what I'm told is never for certain
Lady love rides a big red Cadillac
Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean
So ride in line shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoestrings on Louise
Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swine herd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow
All those city women want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them
Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And se&ntildeorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through
You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the specter he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived
I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there what's his color I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch
A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore
Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded must be displayed
Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here
His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing
In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend
And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Well I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died
But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life
Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then breaks all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends
Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die
Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose
And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in
Should I cry sanctuary
No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore
The king is dead, the king is dead
The king is dead, the king is dead
Long live the king
It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon
Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born
On the big screen they showed us the sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one
And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I
If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well don't you try to stop me
I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned
Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows
Well if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
And I swear it's going to be the death of me
I pulled out my Stage Coach Times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And hung my head in shame
Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun
Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast
The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law
Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun
Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Lord I say now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun
Lord I say now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun
In the quiet silent seconds I turned off the light switch
And I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room
Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way
Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a true love like hers is a hard love to get
And I've walked most all the way and I ain't heard her call
And I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all
Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way
There are women and women and some hold you tight
While some leave you counting the stars in the night
Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really going fine for eighty four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home
Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day
Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch
I'll catch the tramline in the morning
With your leave Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed
Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said you'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm
Van Bushell saw the hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said now calm you down my brother
Let's discuss this man to man
It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage
You're the son of your father
Try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you
With blood and water bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
Well slowly Joseph well he lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well
He said now hey blind man that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride
Well Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said let me just refresh your mind
Your manners boy seem hard to find
Well there's two men lying dead as nails
On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument
That only leads to harm
So be careful when they're kind to you
Don't you end up in the dirt
Just remember what I'm saying to you
And you likely won't get hurt
From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the northern plain
To wear the color of the greys and join the fight again
I'll not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans well that's just fine alright
`Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring
I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing
Half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed
So where to now St. Peter
If it's true I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now St. Peter
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on
It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range
I took myself a blue canoe
The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
You say it's very hard
To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child
And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other
I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child
Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey
Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child
Why hello, say can I buy you another glass of beer
Well thanks a lot that's kind of you, it's nice to know you care
These days there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
I may be just an old soldier to some
But I know how it feels to grow old
Yeah that's right, you can see me here most every night
You'll always see me staring at the walls and at the lights
Funny I remember oh it's years ago I'd say
I'd stand at that bar with my friends who've passed away
And drink three times the beer that I can drink today
Yes I know how it feels to grow old
I know what they're saying son
There goes old man Joe again
Well I may be mad at that I've seen enough
To make a man go out his brains
Well do they know what it's like
To have a graveyard as a friend
`Cause that's where they are boy, all of them
Don't seem likely I'll get friends like that again
Well it's time I moved off
But it's been great just listening to you
And I might even see you next time I'm passing through
You're right there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
So keep well, keep well old friend
And have another drink on me
Just ignore all the others you got your memories
You got your memories
You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know
Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep
Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spend his days counting
In a garage by the motorway
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said God is dead 
And the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leaving Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing
While Levon, Levon slowly dies
Has anybody here seen Razor Face
I Heard he's back looking for a place to lay down
Must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him round
Needs a man who's young to walk him round
Oh it must be hard for the likes of you to get by
In a world that you just can't see through
And it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home
How does it feel to know you can't go home
Come on Razor Face my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, oh amazing grace
Protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why
I love your Razor Face
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know
Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat dear
It looks like rain
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the madman across the water
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know
The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black
or are the windows painted
Will they come again next week
Can my mind really take it
As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted teepee
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns
Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears
I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run
Trampling down the prairie rose leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead
Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole
Boston at last and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn
Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town
Slow down Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel baby like the Holiday Inn
Oh I don't even know if it's Cleveland or Maine
With the buildings as big and rooms just the same
And the TV don't work and the French fries are cold
And the room service closed about an hour ago
We've moved on six miles from where we were yesterday
And yesterday is but a long long ways away
So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight
And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed
I left from the dockland two years ago now
Made my way over on the S.S. Marie
And I've always had trouble wherever I've settled
Rotten peaches are all that I see
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun
There ain't no green grass in a U.S. state prison
There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife
And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches
You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life
Oh I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills
For I lie in the light of the Lord
And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away
And I guess I won't see it no more
If it came to pass that they should ask
What could I tell them
Would they criticize behind my back
Maybe I should let them
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand 
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy 
Into a full-blooded city man
If they could face it
I could take it in their eyes
Oh I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows just fake it
If only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man
But I know the way they want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man
Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul
And now that it's all over
The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain
And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand 
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs
For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon
I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
When I look back boy I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights honey I was blind
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh the change is gonna do me good
You better get back honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky from a bottle of wine
Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home well, said I was a fool
They said oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule
They said stay at home boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city boy, is going to break your heart
But how can you stay, when your heart says no
How can you stop when your feet say go
Cool grass blowing up the pass
Don't you know I'm feeling mellow
I love your Roman nose, the way you curl your toes baby
Make me feel so mellow
It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain
You make me mellow, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
You make me mellow, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me Lord
But God this is a mellow time
Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Don't forget the beer my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed
And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through life
Down in the pass where the wind blows fast
And mellow's feeling right
I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a forty four
Give them all a surprise
Think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are
I'd make an exception
If you want to save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night
I got frostbitten in the winter
Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her
I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Suzie by my side
Well she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Suzie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine
I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
Living proof as she swirls
She's a dancer
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man, a rocket man
And I think it's gonna be a long long time...
I have to say my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're gonna need a helping hand
I have to say my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed
It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation
A chance to put the devil down
Without the fear of hell
Salvation spreads the gospel round
And free you from yourself
There's a river running sweat right through our land
Driven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand
And I've taken just as much as I can stand
Oh we've got to free our brothers from their shackles if we can
Most nights I have to watch my woman cry
Every day I watch the colonel smile
His painted ladies riding in from town
I swear one day I'm gonna burn that whore house to the ground
Slave, slave
To fight the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave
There's a rumor of a war that's yet to come
That may free our families and our sons
It may lay green lands to barren wastes
The price of release is a bitter blow to face
Tread on my face if you like little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to baby
But don't you cross me off your list
I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy
You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my neck `cause I love you all the same
Amy I know you don't have to show your affection
`Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town Amy
I'm beaten on the streets `cause I loves you
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle you see
Amy I may not be James Dean
Amy I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams
And now I know
Spanish Harlem are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow in New York City
Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light
This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes I might join in
I'll go my way alone
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found
Ooh I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
Like an out of tune guitar
Ooh she got Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes
Some men like the Chinese life
Some men kneel and pray
Ooh well I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way
I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough man routine up her sleeve
Living and loving, kissing and hugging
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
Oh and it hurts like hell to see my gal
Messing with a muscle boy
No superman gonna ruin my plans
Playing with my toys
Rich man sweating in a sauna bath
Poor boy scrubbing in a tub
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
Washing in a bucket of mud
Washing in a bucket of mud
Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much
Daniel my brother you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
Oh God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
I was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean
She's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me
It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane
Oh teacher I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, Teacher I need you
I have to write a letter
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees
So I'm sitting in the classroom
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances
I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing
There's a fly in the window
A dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner
I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too
Well I can't help thinking
About the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me
Cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine
Drunk all the time
Feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days
We'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together
Without a wife in line
To pick the crop and get me hot
On elderberry wine
Round a tree in the summer
A fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round
Like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand
Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus
And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Gonna go west to the sea
The greyhound is swaying
And the radio is playing
Some blues for baby and me
And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me
Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus
Walk a mile in my tennis shoes
Tina Turner gave me the highway blues
But I don't love nobody but you honey
I'm true rat for the things I done
Second cousin to a son of a gun
I'm gonna wipe out your mama if she puts me on honey
'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse
Well there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do
Long haired ladies well they look so fine
Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine
But, I don't think those ladies they really mind honey
I still don't know why you hate me so
A little bit of fun never stopped no show
Well I just want to loosen up my soul honey
Have you heard the dogs at night
Somewhere on the hill
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill
Oh there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry
Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change
Don't you hear him any more
Praying Lord you got to help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend
Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down
And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home
Well there's slim times when my words won't rhyme
And the hills I face are a long hard climb
I just sit cross legged with my old guitar
It kind of makes me feel like a rock and roll star
Well it makes me laugh Lord it makes me cry
And I think for once let me just get high
Let me get electric put a silk suit on
Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun
And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive gonna know my name
An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene
I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm gonna be a teenage idol no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm gonna grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol that's what I'm gonna be
Well life is short and the world is rough
And if you're gonna boogie boy you got to be tough
Nobody knows if I'm dead or alive
I just drink myself to sleep each night
And so I pray to the teenage god of rock
If I make it big let me stay on top
You got to cut me loose from this one room dive
Put me on the ladder keep this boy alive
I heard from a friend you'd been messing around
With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown
Well I don't know if I like that idea much
Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough
You out of town guys sure think you're real keen
Think all of us boys are homespun and green
But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red
So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddamit you're all gonna die
How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
With your communistic politics and them negro blues
Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
Spending the summertime naturally high
I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
when Suzie wore her dresses tight
and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last
You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
I saw it as you flew between my reason
Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird
The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away
The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die
Oh it doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands
I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow
Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of Mummy-doesn't-love-me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen
And hey, hey, hey, you know what I mean
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me
Wait till my husband's away
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in Soho
One or two middle-aged dykes in a Go-Go
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo
And hey, hey, hey, oh don't you know
Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Bennie and the Jets
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Bennie and the Jets
[Instrumental]
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the jets
Bennie, Bennie and the jets
When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light coloured candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf
And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon
Oh this song's got no title just words and a tune
Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for my darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel
When she gets up in the morning
It's enough to wake the dead
Oh she turning on the radio
And dancing on my head
It's no good living in the sun
Playing guitar all day
Boogalooing with my friends
In that erotic way
Come on Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica Jerk-off that way
Let the ladies and the gentlemen
Be as rude as they like
On the beaches, oh in the jungle
Where the people feel alright
So do it Jamaica
Got plenty for you and me
Honky tonking with my baby
In that deep blue sea
I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think I don't have a clue
Baby you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too
The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles, with the knives in their eyes
Well their actions become so absurd
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
`Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blue print for all of your B films
Because I've seen that movie too
I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned
If the boys all behave themselves here
Well there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh the prices I charge here will see you alright
So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you
Oh sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game
Forget us we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said
Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids
Now it's all over Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well `cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age
I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshots in your pants if you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs
I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down scrub her back
And turn her inside out
`Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years
Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped
I could really get off being in your shoes
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues
A heard of a place at the back of town
Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you honey where the scene's on fire"
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired
Oh your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Out bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me
Somebody help me `cause the bug bit me
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays
And your sister rocks all my blues away
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you honey where the scene's on fire"
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired
It's getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
`Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright alright alright
Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!"
A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtain and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon
And Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the T.V., shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoofbeats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed
My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose
And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinner time and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease
My landlady lives in a caravan
Well that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams
Hello, baby hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend that you know
Harmony and me
We're pretty good company
Looking for an island
In our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee I really love you
And I want to love you forever
And dream of the never, never, never leaving harmony
Hello, baby hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace
By stealing the show, say hello, hello
I was justified when I was five
Raising cane, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back
Eat meat on Friday that's alright
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch
`Cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that
Oh it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back
I don't want to wake you
But I'd like to tell you that I love you
That the candlelight fell like a crescent 
Upon your feather pillow
For there's more ways than one
And the ways of the world are a blessing
For when Pinky's dreaming
She owes the world nothing
And her silence keeps us guessing
Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands
You don't want to tell me
But somehow you've guessed that I know
Oh when dawn came this morning
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul
For there's toast and honey
And there's breakfast in bed on a tray
Oh it's ten below zero
And we're about to abandon our plans for the day
As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing
Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby
Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbor
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers
Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay
Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees
My little boat she rocks easy
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way
Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Ploughing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run
Papa says that I'm a dreamer
Says them skeetas bit me one too many times
Oh but I never get lonesome living on the river
Watching old Lily leave the world behind
Oh ma cameo molesting
Kee pa a poorer for tea
Solar prestige a gammon
Lantern or turbert paw kwee
Solar prestige a gammon
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Har ring molassis abounding
Common lap kitch sardin a poor floundin
Cod ee say oo pay a loto
My zeta prestige toupay a floored
Ray indee pako a gammon
Solar prestige a pako can nord
I've a constant ache in the morning light
It's on account of the night before
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore
But I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watch'll do instead
City living woman, you're so static
Matching your men with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in New York City
Them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie
Said you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
If they catch you, oh oh oh it could turn out bad
It's a Show me what you want, I'll show you what I've got
I can show you a real good time
She's a friend indeed of a friend in need
But you'll be sorry when she leaves you crying
Tune in, wouldn't it be something
Rumours spreading into panic
I've seen movements in the clearing
Someone sent you something satanic
I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded
I wouldn't fool you but I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune
I've seen them I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go
Stars climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me mother earth
It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light
Say what you will but I'm a stinker
I come crawling up out of my hole
Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose
I'm a perfect curse to pest control
Seeds and weeds and muddy meals
Crawling around the earth
Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
I hibernate in English turf
Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burning vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave honey
Tell me what you hound dogs think
Set in my styles with a beady eye
I got connections with the underground
Call me a common rodent boy
Sitting here safe and sound
Some mole hill mother sauntered by
Acting like the ace of spades
Don't give that cutey no reason to shoot me
When I'm living on the eggs she laid
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
I can't find the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal
"An extremely quiet child" they called you in your school reports
"He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught"
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died
At St. Patricks every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
"Oh, he's unconcerned with competition he never cares to win"
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son
"Now you'll never get to Heaven" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking
They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said "His brain's just snapped" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground
Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh your childhood cried out in your head "they mean to do you harm"
"Don't ever ride on the devil's knee" Mama said
Remember mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking
Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule
Oh they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
"Throw out your gun, walk out slow just keep your hands held high"
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law
"You've slept too long in silence" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking
Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
A radio humming in every car, and it feels like the clocks have stopped
Calypso moon just cast its spell
We grabbed that magic just because
We remember and never forget what a wonderful crazy night that was
Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that takes you back, won't let you go
Someday if you're asking all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was, yeah
Loose clothes and a cool, cool drink
A greasy breeze from the chicken stand
Hearts on fire just one last time, a wishbone snapping in every hand
Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that takes you back, won't let you go
Someday if you're asking all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was
We found a place to feel it, we knew where we were at
Stop the bar, don't have a future, don't everybody need a life like that
Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
We remember and never forget what a wonderful crazy night that was
Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that takes you back, won't let you go
Someday if you're asking all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was
Got a penny in my pocket
And a dollar in my hand
But I'll drop it in your tin cup
Cause you were a one man band
If I could make a million
On some TV show
On the roulette wheel
In a great big casino
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I got my favorite hat
With that snakeskin band
When you need a little shake
I've put it in your hands
To the bottom of the ocean
I would surely dive
To find the oldest oyster
With the biggest pearl inside
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I'd claim a confront
I'd claim a tune
All the undiscovered territory
Out there beyond the moon
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
You're holding back
You're hard to read
Your a 21st century kind
You're lighting fast
Built for speed
A tight lipped modern mind
An architect
Of grand romance
You're a mystery of disguise
You're holed up in your house
Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the Mother of Invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me
Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again
Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need
Yesterday did someone else's song
In sixty-five summertime, don't let go
Long before you came, blue wonderful
The blue wonderful I know
Ain't just something I just left behind
In the past, far away, used to be
But your presence, my blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me
Go where you want, when you want to
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Stick around the light that brings you home
Don't ever hang around with the breeze
Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need
Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me
Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful, again
I am the elder Utah Smith
I've got two wings to fly
They may be made of paper
They may never reach the sky
But I believe in mercy
I believe that man is good
And if they want two wings like me
There's a chance they could
I am the elder Utah Smith
I was born in Cedar Grove
That's in Louisiana
On a dirt-poor stretch of road
I found the calling early
Gave birth to righteous words
And in a tent around the South
I took my sonic church
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last
I am the elder Utah Smith
I take all as they are
I was the first man of the cloth
To blacken a guitar
Love was my redeemer
I felt it from the start
The Holy Ghost was channeled
Through the sound of my guitar
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last
Been a long time in the ground
Unmarked is my grave
But I reside elsewhere these days
Thanks to souls I've saved
I traveled far, I traveled wide
Three quarts for the Lord
Till one day he called me home
To claim his great reward
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last
Don't shy away from coming in
Closer still my darling friend
Don't slip, don't trip on life
I bear the moon
Inside your eyes
Don't be afraid of all my years
What you see or what you hear
It's all yours and yours and yours alone
Yours for the taking, so take it home
Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you
Oh sure it's cracked a time or two
But him and me, we pulled on through
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Some went through fast
Some went real slow
So take a chance, and take your time
Reading my face between the lines
I love real good, and I love you
My heart and me
That's what we do
Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you
Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you
Figuring out where I went wrong
The script not followed, then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not acting up
I wore the world upon my back
Though someone else could meet, pick up the slack
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
Time is wasted looking back
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear
I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
Looking up, looking up
Looking up, looking up
Hand it over reach across the line
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
What is it you want, what you think you'll find
Inside of this old heart of mine
Come on out, cause you want to play
The rain went east, come to roll away
Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
I roamed around looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went, what I went though
A bit too hard to find a way to you
I can't move so never really could
Sing a song that you understood
It's what you do when you think you should
Surrender like you knew you always would
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
Hold out, distilling down
What's it going to be
Never tell in a million years
No, you can't get enough of me
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
It feels like I'm flying
When I see your face
I'm charged with a power
Of amazing grace
I flip the switch signal
On the permanent dream
Like the palm of my hand
On a tambourine
Dumb rocks filling up
My poor head
Did you just say
What I thought you said
First cat back here gets the cream
And bounce a little river
Of my tambourine
Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
A curveball coming
That I didn't see
A flash flood washing
Out a dried up creek
A went in muddy
But I came out clean
Like a Baptist banging
On a tambourine
Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
You're a spinning-round gypsy in the moonlight
Cymbals flashing in the firelight
I'm freefalling into a dream
My hidden heart banging
Like the tambourine
Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
You gotta think about it
You gotta make a wish and count to ten
There's just a sense of wonder
I feel a new direction looking down the lens
Jump started the action
Heard a song in my head and wrote it down
It came out of nowhere
Felt a new sensation driving you through town
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
You're gonna see some changes
Gotta pinch myself just to believe
Everybody's having something
But I can tell you've got some magic up your sleeve
Some deep protection
When a feeling follows you around
I always need the silence
Or the lightning you bring like a new good sound
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Sat around and waited for a spark
And it brightened up the night
Before I get much older
I want the pleasure of seeing you up in lights
I could then beside you
Hand over my heart and say a prayer
Love's not for quitters
It's a satisfaction
Knowing that you're there
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide
Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away
They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion
Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away
Oceans away
Where the green grass sways
And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves.
Shoulder to shoulder back in the day
Sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away
Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away
Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed, you never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France
Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down
And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone wall
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all
A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner
And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome
Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons
And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said "I'm gonna keep this good luck
Piece of iron inside my truck"
The boy just whispered "OK"
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog
Dull as a ploughshare rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,
For a dollar and a half
[Chorus:]
Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee
That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
"Gone to California"
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that west bound stage
One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee
"Say that boy's a wonderment"
"No! The kid's a freak"
But that kid he don't care none
His black hands resting on the keys
Hoppin' like a big old frog
And hissin' like a train
Entertaining royalty
All points east, west and in-between
General he's a fine old man
Treat him like his own
"Boy wouldn't know from money"
Just throw old Blind Tom a bone
From the times of King Cotton
May we present to you
All you Jim Crow monkeys
From Harlan County down to Tuscaloo
Play me anything you like
I'll play it back to you
Be careful what you call me though
Some things cut clear on through
I may be an idiot
I may be a savant
I didn't choose this life for me
But it's something that I want
Cocks that old big head aside
Grunts a word or two
Keeps 'em guessin' every night
Is he really gonna make it through
Faint hearts with their fans out
Starched collars and cigars
He weren't no use for slavin'
"I wouldn't want him in my yard"
I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload
So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand
I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand
I'm going down
You and me together going down
It's not what I'd been told about this town
That when you least expect if you can drown
In quicksand
My quicksand
My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand
My quicksand
I blew the dust out of the corners
Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire
Should have called you up this morning
But I'm such a fool at times
I still search my shaving mirror
Looking for your face with mine
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight
Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile
You're the last chance on the highway
I'm that open stretch of road
You're the diner in my rear-view
A cup of coffee getting cold
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight
Bruised in this cold war of words
We've come undone two loose ends alone
Possessed by that curse you've endured
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home
And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight
I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse
I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new
And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart
I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war
And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse
I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new
And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart
I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war
And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
I'm counting on a memory to get me out of here
I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I've spent being someone else's friend
Just one more time, for old time's sake I'd like to go back home again
The world had seven wonders once upon a time
It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline
And all around me I've seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I'd say amen if I could get back home again
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again
Could have been a jailbreak and the spotlight hitting me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again
Spare the rod don't spare the fool
If you take the breaks you're given
You get to make the rules
Take a chance and make it fast
If you break some bones on landing
You know you're built to last
Fight the tide and find the shore
If the gift horse isn't smiling
Just learn to ride some more
Common sense is a rule of thumb
If the suckers throw a red flag
Blow 'em all to Kingdom Come
And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellsplring
Purify the stream
Search out days that never end
If it's only for the chance
To feel just like a child again
Tell a lie that speaks the truth
If the heart becomes a prisoner
Your soul will turn you loose
And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellsplring
Purify the stream
And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellsplring
Purify the stream
Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn
Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light
Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through
And the dancers danced on through
I carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died?
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eye
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
Took a high dive arcing out wide
Into the crowd
Out to the sound of their wild applause
But you've heard it before
And you've seen it all
From up there on the diving board
You'd free fall into the ether
Above the people
Out on a limb fragile and adored
But who below knows that
You're still a mystery
Way up on the diving board
Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise
But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board
Took the grand prize you and your eyes
Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board.
Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise
But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board
Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise
But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board
And the view from the diving board
We heard Richard Nixon say, welcome to the USA
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We've fallen in and I can't pull back
And I guess we'll have to stay
In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We're finally on our way
And Richard Nixon's on his knees he's sent so many overseas
He'd like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two, pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say "welcome to the USA"
Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were where it's at
Or so the papers say
And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we'd never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson's promised land
Where Disney's God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay
In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
I guess he's just about the coolest guy I've ever seen
And for you and me that speeding car is how it's going to be
I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline
Oh we heard Richard Nixon say, welcome to the USA
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We've fallen in and I can't pull back
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say, I've gotta go but you can stay
I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Loving like an innocent stranger
But something was just out of sight
How could I know that you had used me
Fill out some plan of your own
I could have known you'd abused me
Leave me here hurt and alone
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know that you could be just like you should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good
I only sung what I wanted to sing
You were a dream in my mind
I never know how you never could be
It didn't take long for me to find
I guess that it's mine for foresee
Only what I wanted to see
I couldn't know you would be
A player just acting for me
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know you could be just like you should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good
I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Loving like an innocent stranger
But something was just out of sight
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know you could be just like it should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good
You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate
The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air
Yea I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes
Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass
Yea I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes
It's a constant struggle getting up that hill
There's a change of guard every day
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat
You pray a great white whale might come your way
No freeway traffic in the frozen North
Just a chain link fence full of birds
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words
Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale
In a crumbling city we were trapped for days
With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathams down
And a sign on the wall saying, "Hope Allowed"
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone
A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho
Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale
Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale
Luther left at first light Friday morning
Little Dan and Becky wave good-bye
They're gonna have to share the wait together
Idle hands will see a good fire slowly die.
Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, hope springs eternal
When flags and bullets start to fly
April's come and the air smells fresh with rain
They watched his shadow fade around the bend
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men
Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, time passes slowly
When flags and bullets start to fly
The old black rooster sang in death down that dirt road
His steps in bold, his man of fancy free
I pray we see him alive and well in the forehead
In that Godforsaken place in Tennessee
Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, men stand united
When flags and bullets start to fly
After all this, if we should prevail
Heaven help the South
When Sherman comes their way
I'm out here in the darkness
I hear the howling wind
Sometimes I sit and wonder
Will I ever see love again
Looking for an answer
Not an easy thing to find
Out here in the wilderness
With questions on my mind
Now the sun is rising higher in the sky
The morning light is crawling
From the darkness of the night
The raindrops keep on falling
There is no light of day
The sadness deep inside me
Doesn't seem to go away
And there's no way out. no road home
I'm lost in doubt and I'm all alone
The time has come
When love is done
Hearts have finally turned to stone
No more bright tomorrow, only sad today
My heart is filled with sorrow
The pain won't go away
Try to keep from crying
All night long and through the day
Lost and all alone
Hearts have finally turned to stone
No more bright tomorrow, only sad today
My heart is filled with sorrow
The pain won't go away
Just try to keep from crying
All night long and through the day
Lost and all alone
Hearts have finally turned to stone
I'm looking at a funeral wagon rolling down
A two-lane highway winding past a desert town
A big blue canvas painted by the Master's hand
The shifting clouds above and endless miles of sand
In that mirror maybe that's what's left of me
Wheezing like a freight train hauling sixty tons of steel
Air 'em out's the best release and get some rest
Carrie don't wait up for me the brakeman's going West
In this room all alone
I dream of you
In this drawer I found someone
I never knew
Now I pop a top and stay up late with Gideon
And fall asleep to visions of Meridian
I've seen dusty beaten delta boys cutting heads
A black face carney showman scare a song to death
In my short life I've seen as much as most men need
Now I'm just looking for some cleaner air to breathe
Far away, far away
So many years, so many days
All along this broken land
I've seen a lover's empty arms
And hunger's empty hand
There's no time for waiting, 
No future to see, 
Inside the next moment, 
Nothing might be, 
The answer is not certain, 
No time to decide, 
Is this the last curtain? 
There's no place to hide. 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's only today. 
We all know the story, 
We've heard it before, 
We end up no question, 
Outside of death's door, 
There's no easy answer, 
To the question at hand, 
So easy to ask, 
And not understand. 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's only today, 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's no tomorrow, 
There's only today. 
There's only today.
If you're looking for the glory
You think that you might find
In a bullet-riddled stolen car
On a back road in the pines
If it's round just like a medal
On a tired old man of war
Or hidden like that Burma Star
In my dad's bottom drawer
Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Build your ladder to the moon
Beat on that sacred drum
Trample on the hands of those
That cling to every rung
Every seed you crush beneath
Like stone ground in a mill
You never drew a decent breath
But you're just dressed to kill
Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit
I hear you singing, "I Shall Be Released"
Like a chainsaw running through a masterpiece
But that's all right, that's ok
Grab the bottle and slide my way
You dreamt of a devil down below
Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl
But he's a fool and he's a thief
Got silly little horns and pointed teeth
Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
There's a canyon where an echo hangs
Like the ancient bells of Notre Dame
It's beyond the hills out of sight
Thought I heard 'em ringing all last night
Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above
Rains will come sweet and clean
Let the tears of God keep the mountains green
Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
One big sun coming up
Old moon going down
Thunder breaking in the east
I'm gonna love you 'til it comes around
Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
I can hear your heart
Pounding in my ear
Now I feel the sound
And the time is near
I feel the taste
Of all the things you do
Now the time has come
I know you're a dream come true
You make me so complete
With the things you do
And the music's sweet
You make me feel brand new
I hear the sound
Songs start coming through
Somehow I know
That you're a dream come true
It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day
And life is good
Each and every way
Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And the blues are through
And now I know
What I'm gonna do
Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And all the blues are through
Now I know
What I'm gonna do
It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day
And life is good
Each and every way
Are you standing outside?
Looking up at the sky
Cursing a wondering star
Well If I were you
I'd throw rocks at the moon
I'd say damn you wherever you are
I don't know where to start
This cage 'round my heart
Locked up what I'd meant to say
Or I felt all along the way
Just wondering how come
I couldn't take your breath away
Cause I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
When I should've sent roses
When you crossed my mind
No other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should've sent roses
Looking back on my life
Oh, if fate should decide
I could do it all over again
I'd build no more walls
I'd stay true and recall
The fragrance of you on the wind
You'll get better than me
Someone who can see
Right from the start
Given all that you need
I'll slip away
Knowing I'm half the man I could be
Cause I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
And I should have sent roses
When you crossed my mind
For no other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should've sent roses
Yeah should've sent roses
They say we bruise too easily 
I don't know if it's that way for me 
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go 
I've seen everyone I know 
Fall in and out of love 
It's just the way it goes 
Word is out, silence seems so loud 
There's no light above or below me now 
I've seen it grow, I've seen it live 
I've seen everything I give 
Falling out my hands, no matter who I'm with 
And nobody ever tells you 
When love is dying, when love is dying 
It just gets a little colder 
And we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying 
Oh when love is dying 
There's a pain you never can explain 
Cuts so deep time and time again 
I felt it then, I feel it now 
But nobody told me how 
To fight a world of hurt 
Somebody help me now 
But love never gets to show you 
And I never got to know you 
No we never stood a chance 
When love was dying 
No and love never makes it easy 
And I never got that feeling 
No we never stood a chance 
When love was dying 
Don't abandon life
Don't step away
Don't give up that tune
That you never could play
If you're folding your tent
And the gas pipes groan
If every bone rattles
Through nights all alone
Well you're tougher than leather
No old burlap sack
Not some hard scrabble weeds
Growing up through the cracks
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
You're never too old to hold somebody
Don't think you've gone out
Don't flicker and fade
If you're gonna get lemons
Then do what they say
The wind makes you weary
It knocks you around
Logs on the fire
Beats sun shining down
But you're harder than nails
No skinny old tack
You're still sharp as a razor
And I like you like that
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
You're never too old to hold somebody
I could bet on a horse
But I'm betting on you
You still got what it takes
You got nothing, nothing to prove
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
You're never too old to hold somebody
Well I could have been sick
I could have died
I could have given up
And not tried
To make it to tomorrow
Like a brokenhearted lover
But there was a brand new start
And suddenly I was taken
New and faraway places
And the music I was shaken
It was a whole new race
When I woke on that first day
There was nothing I could say
I was in the hands of angels
Johnny and the governor
Came and brought me to my senses
They made me feel just like a king
Made me lose all my bad defenses
And they knew all the places
I needed to go
All of the people
I needed to know
They knew who I needed
And who needed me
And who would come help me
And who would just let me be
I was in the hands of angels
Until this very day
Inside the hands of angels
What more can I say
When you're in the hands of angels
Life is oh so sweet
And you feel the love
Down deep inside
Even out there on the street
In the hands of angels
It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yea just like Noah's ark
Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yea it's just like Noah's ark
And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark
These four walls have seen
The Cockettes and the Casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark
And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page
But for every tiny dancer there's a dog that's had its day
The truth is never quite the same as what the papers say
I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing side-by-side
Loading up the boys at night
Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight
But I wouldn't have it any other way
This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it
New York City I'd really like to stay
New York City I wouldn't have you
I wouldn't have you any other way
Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where Joey Gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside
I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right
Nostradamus said I predict
That the world will end at half past six
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed
We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox (tinderbox)
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox
Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June
The sun descends down in Mexico
While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are gonna have to change
Some holes along the road get filled
Pressure's gonna cook us if we don't unlock it
Guns going off if we don't uncock it
We've gotta climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're gonna burn, out on this beautiful rocket
The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town
Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down
With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time
So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall
And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down
He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The hows and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives
She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl ain't that enough
To rage against the day
And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away
He shone so bright with a lust for life
Like the Sun King that he was
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth
And for reasons I never understood
About the choices made between the bad and good
I've tried to figure out but
The pain never goes away
And there's marble markers and little white crosses
Along the beaten path
And I've spread their ashes on the wind
And I miss John Lennon's laugh
I've seen the bridge and the bridge is long
And they built it high and they built it strong
Strong enough to hold the weight of time
Long enough to leave some of us behind
And every one of us has to face that day
Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
And every one of us that ever came to play
Has to cross the bridge or fade away
Standing on the bridge looking at the waves
Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide
And the bridge it shines
Oh cold hard iron
Saying come and risk it all
Or die trying
I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore
But some are always in my heart
And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure
From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess I must have lost it on the wind
Back when I was younger each one was a prize
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes
And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse
Some would want to bleed you dry
Some might quench your thirst
In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind
Hey how about this
A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights
Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on Oxford Street
Now we're sitting in the South of France
Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees
Old '67 what a time it was
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you
Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee Williams play
Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall
Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I've been out on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showing my friends around
I've seen it growing from next to nothing
Into a giant eating up your town
Called up the tealeaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands
She saw a mountain and wild deer running
A crazy kid becoming a better man
But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waiting to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasing the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine silk Suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt
And you can't go back and if you try it fails
Looking up ahead I see a rusty nail
A sign hanging from it saying "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all just one more tale
About the Captain and the Kid
We've been missing at times in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes
Oh we've conjured up what we created
Way back then when I was standing up in six-inch heels
Now you're riding off into the sunset
And I'm still spinning like a Catherine wheel
But we stuck around for the battle
Waiting for a plan
To turn you into the Brown Dirt Cowboy
And me into a rocket man
It pleases the people some of the time
Digging into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots
I'm weary and I'm staying up late
And the rain hits my roof so hard
You know I'm no longer thirty
These days I'm happy to play
One or two hands of cards
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back
Humidity hangs like a curtain
Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
You know I've still got my eyesight
These days I'm happy to see
A sunset instead of a line
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back
There's a long list of names
That I don't recall
Even though my memory's good
The rain washed away
The lemons and weeds
When the weight of the world weighed more than it should
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back
There's a porch swing in Tupelo
In the shade of the south
Where the sweet honey drips off that old hush-yo'-mouth
It's a slow road on down
That old Natchez Trace
Through Alabama cotton fields to a state of grace
It's a crisp golden Autumn
On the Tennessee line
Rolling down to Mississippi like you headed back in time
Town's closed on Sunday
Everybody's in church
It's empty as the moon this place here on earth
And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
His mama must have loved him
That truck drivin' boy
With the grease monkey look and the rock 'n roll voice
Well I was just thinkin' 'bout him
'Cause I guess he sat here
Singing all praise to God through poverty's tears
And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking' myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking' myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
I got nothing to do but hang in the breeze
The ghosts of the old south all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
On this porch swing in Tupelo
Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
Here on this porch swing in Tupelo
Well they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope inside
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky
Well they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold on to something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown
All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky
Your bags out on the bed
Your closet's all cleared out
You say you're goin' to Jacksonville
'Cause our love's all worn out
You're searching in my eyes
To try and find a tear
But the well of my forgiveness
Has dried up with the years
You might still look pretty
In that lacey little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess
I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
It's like a prime time movie
You play the part so well
You do believe you're Heaven sent
And livin' here is hell
I hear it's hot in Florida
And it's raining here tonight
But the sun's gonna shine tomorrow
And I'm gonna do alright
You might still look pretty
In that lacey little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess
I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh, and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
You might still look pretty
In that lacey little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess
I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
And darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I'm not the same as I used to be
All the things you've heard seem hard to believe
Haven't always been good, never really been bad
Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad
Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck
But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
I may paint your picture, and I might grow a beard
There were times I was crazy couldn't handle my life
Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price
But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
And I've taken the pills
I got burnt out and chilled by the cold
But I've no regrets and that being said
You know cheap thrills can get pretty old
Yeah, Yeah, oh Yeah
But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
She threw back that shiny hair
Like the mane on a Delta queen
Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call
'Cause she's the wildest thing I've ever seen
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood
Now they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now Billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
She just does that double act
She got Babs and Joan down pat
She got hips like Mick, she's a Rolling Stone
Never seen a woman shake like that
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood
Now they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now Billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
She's so fine that the water line
Don't separate hot and cold
She got stitched up bitchy by an old M.D.
Now she's headed out to Hollywood or so I'm told
Now they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now Billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now Billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat
Me and you we're not that pretty
Me and you could use a lift
I'm out here on the corner crying
I got ribbons but I got no gift
Me and you we're all we've got
Me and you could be our curse
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
You got strings but you got no purse
We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike
And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love
There's a wonder in this weakness
It's so beautiful sometimes
Across the universe we're lightning
In the race we're a step behind
Me and you we're not for everyone
Me and you we're damaged goods
We're antique and unacceptable
And just misunderstood
Breaking down never seems to be that hard
Falling short is always in the cards
I'm on the road, sunrise is at my back
Lost it all somewhere between the cracks
I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones
And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, So thankful
I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed
Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
My desire never winds up on top
I can say now I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach somewhere beyond this room
I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones
And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed
I always try to make things clear
Then I watched as progress starts
I only hope I'm standing here
When heaven finally comes to call
We are still all right
We took it on the chin
But in the thirteenth hour
No one ever wins
But we're strong enough
Like traffic all tied up
And when the static clears
The radios still buzz
And I stop and I breathe
'Cause you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
'Cause I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have
Like blood in a vein
We chased this one down
And in the darkest long night
We turned it all around
And it was coal-dusted snow
That covered the fields
But the corn it still grew
And the injury healed
And I stop and I breathe
'Cause you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
'Cause I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have
And I stop and I breathe
'Cause you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
'Cause I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have
Did you see the first man on the moon?
Have you seen the first light of day?
When there wasn't someone stuck inside
Something like the moon
Something like a star that's lost its way
Did you go to Dallas on that day?
Have you been to where they broke a dream?
Where there really isn't room for doubt
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere inbetween
And everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
'Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
The mystery of why they had to leave
I'm only one of thousands saying why
Why a balcony in Memphis Tennessee
Seems trapped in time
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky
Would you wait to stand inside his shoes?
And is the best all you have to give
The barefoot man lived a simple life
I guess he knew
Something's die so other things might live
So everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
'Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Oh come on everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
'Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
It's getting dark in here
Don't want to leave
Shadow's falling
And I believe
Winds picking up
Thing's so unclear
I'm afraid of my shadow
And it's getting dark in here
I'm scared of strangers
On the street
World's so ugly
I can't breath
Moon's so spooky
I'm close to tears
I've lost it all
And it's getting dark in here
And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And I'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here
Don't talk about angels
Or how I'll be saved
I'm no coward
But I'm not that brave
Rags are blowing
Rain's getting near
I'm done with running
And it's getting dark in here
And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And I'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here
And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And I'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here
Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here
I can't keep this from you
I've held it in so long
It's time to tell the truth
Keeping it from you is wrong
I can't keep this from you
It's so simple I'm afraid
When I tell you how I feel
You'll just laugh and call me crazy
And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
I can't keep this from you
It's hard to breathe in here
I just seem to act the fool
Every time I feel you near
I can't keep this from you
No matter what you say
Anything is better now
Than going through my life this way
And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
And I love every move you make
Can't you hear every heart you break?
And don't you know when I hear your name?
Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames
And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
Oh no I just can't keep this from you
We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes
And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes
We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes
Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you
Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond
Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love
I'll take a rainy day
To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower
Been to Philadelphia 
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road
The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma
Look Ma no hands
Look Ma ain't life grand
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Ain't you proud of me
It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust
Been down in Roswell
When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain
Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt
Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from
'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming
See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent
Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof
Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place
I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside
Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin, 
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin 
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin
A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life
Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand
There's some things I don't have now
Some things I don't talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides 
There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Cold hard truths I can't face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass 
And everywhere I look there's something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
Don't answer the question of where we belong
How come birds 
Don't fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
Can't explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide
These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark
And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
Don't answer the question of what I am to you
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man I've seen so much traffic
So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
Some days I think it's all a dream
The things I've done, the places that I've been
This life of mine seemed surreal at times
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind
Could it be I'm not for real?
I've slapped my face to check out how I feel
There's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind the mask was never proved
Come on Robert Johnson 
Though we're worlds apart
You and I know what it's like
With the devil in our heart
You sold your soul at the crossroads
Kept a little of mine on hand
I'm wading out this muddy water
Been stranded in the Wasteland
Rattling chains all around my bed
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead
I'm not dying and I'm far from gone
The blues man spent his candle but his pain lives on
I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somehere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen
You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me
You can charm her
Calm her when she's wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me
So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me
You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
She's the love of your life
And no, you'll never, never love her like me
You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places I've been
But you'll never, never love her like me
It's a case I guess of paradise lost
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got
Just you and me at a crossroads then
Ain't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end
And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight'
In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone
In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall
You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles heading west
Picking up my pain from door to door
Riding on the storyline
Furnace burning overtime
But this train don't stop,
This train don't stop,
This train don't stop there anymore
You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
If you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em as they say and weep
I've never felt enough to cry
When I said that I don't care
It really means my engine's breaking down
The chisel chips my heart again
The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground
I used to be a rolling stone
You know if the cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beating for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done
`Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man
Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light
Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do
If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
Some others choose the good old family home
I like living easy without family ties
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
And nobody told us
`Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands
Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
`Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know
Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
and it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me, I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now
Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while I'm away 
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
I guess you're okay
You seem to feel better these days
I've known you for so long
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that's true
You can shake your head but I can prove
I've seen things through your eyes
You think you win but in the end you lose
And there's no second guess
We take no second bets
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love
With words that can't express
The truth implies you're high and dry
And you're a long way from happiness
I'm one step behind
Looking out for you all the time
I'll put my faith in you
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind
I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues
And his promise made was never clear
It just carved itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my head
On the night he said to me
Someday we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls and we'll live like horses
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train
On the road to the golden gate
On the flat cracked desert I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now I shall be free
[Duet with Luciano Pavarotti:]
I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues
La promessa non fu chiara
S'erra solo impressa in me
Vidi solo il gelo dentro me
Quella notte dise a me
Vivrem comme cavalli
Liberi dai recinti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalli
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train
On the road to the golden gate
Nel deserto la nave abbandonai
Per me aveva senso
Son stato troppo tempo nella bestia
Ed ora saro libero
Someday We'll live like horses
Free reign from your old iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls and we'll live like horses
Someday
Liberi dai ricenti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalli
And when we start we say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
We read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe
The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die
And so they say, the end will come for us
And so the world, slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
But I don't believe, I don't believe that the end will come for us
No I won't believe the end will come for us
The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before we sail
We just accept what failure means
I don't know what to say
I don't know where the light shines
It's a grey dawn rising on a green hill
And there's so much behind us
I don't know where we go
I sure feel there's something out there
There's a great awakening and a new morning
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear
If the river can bend
I'll find you waiting
Home at last from the wild sea
All the twists and turns
We've made together
All the boats you rocked
With your harmony
If the river can bend
If the river can bend
If the river can bend
If the river can bend
Come and embrace the struggle
But win or lose we live here
Build a new beginning on an old rock
Breathe deep of the sweet fresh air
Pull my coat around me
Feel the cold wind haunt me
Streets are empty just like me
The murmur of an echo
Seems to come from every window
Is loneliness the same as being free
I guess I must have been dreaming
To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall
Love's got a lot to answer for
Oh I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
Let the cold night air cool the heat
Of two hearts gone to war
For no matter who wins, in the end
Love's got a lot to answer for
All I need is darkness
The best of all protection
Freedom's like the stars in the sky
Alone and cold and burning
Each one keeps it's distance
If only we were stars, you and I
There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell you
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay
And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
With a smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I'm speechless and I don't know where to start
On and on
The story of our lives goes on and on
The path of time
The sunsets up ahead roll along
In your eyes
The option of a warm embrace implies
You're my friend
Happy endings keep our love alive
And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star
Wanna be your main man in the big picture
What a deal
To get a part like this
Day to day
The shifting wind just blows us on our way
Here and there
Our pockets full of things to say
Oh my love
I proudly represent you in this world
Little satellite
Brightest star tonight, oh my love
And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star
Hope I got a future in the big picture
At the last embrace
From the first kiss
And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star
Baby you're missing something in the air
I got a name but it don't matter
What's going on, it's cold in here
You have a life but it's torn and tattered
Maybe you're losing pieces of your heart
You have a world but it stopped turning
You lose the day and gain the dark
Love was a fire but it stopped burning
Spare your heart, save your soul
Don't drag your love across the coals
Find your feet and your fortune can be told
Release, relax, let go 
And hey now let's recover your soul
Lazy old sunset sinking like a tear
Alone at night in a losing battle
That perfect world is never clear
You have to fight for the things that matter
Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine
Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed
Should have had a talk with God
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in Heaven all alone
And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter 
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares
Must have kissed you 'till I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the morning light
Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard
Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
After all these rough seas
Left me reckless and abandoned
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
Break down the cold front
Give me peace and understanding
And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder
Will she still be the star to see me through
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you
No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue
You control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you
Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history
From the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted
Let me burn or bring me water
It's written clear across the room
In silent words the blind could understand
I came here to relax and find
A sleep that soaks me up like surf and sand
And you appear as I descend
A soft outline all poised and feather light
I come into the darkness now
To conjure up a dream and close my eyes
Don't disturb me if you dare 
Join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream
Don't send me back to real life
The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
Leave me in my wicked dream
Where pressure cracks and beauty comes undone
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later
But love, I believe in love
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love, I believe in love
Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me
Without love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I was made in England out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father, had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard and that black piano
Oh that sweet Georgia Peach and the boy from Tupelo
Oh, I was made in England
Oh, I was made in England
I was made in England out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground crying God send me a brother
Not a bloody nose for Rock and Roll
Give me that sweet Georgia Peach and the boy from Tupelo
I was made in England like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal, well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain and nothing to cling to
If you're made in England, you're built to last
You can still say 'homo' and everybody laughs
But the joke's on you, you never read the song
They all think they know but they all got it wrong
This is my house
This is where I live
That is the winter
Those are the trees
I can hear them breathe
This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me
This is my floor
This is where I lie
This is a square room
That was a bright light
These are not my eyes
What is my soul
Where is my tired heart
That is the question
Where is the answer
Inside my house
And I sit by the window
And I wish I was rain
I want to fall from the sky
I want to get wet all over again
'Cause this my house
It belongs to me
Inside my head
It's all that's left
This is my house
This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me
This is my house
You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I keep my distance, I held my breath
Love always ends up hanging by a thread
Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart
But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you, and I'm cold, cold, cold
You said don't cry to me
He said I'm a dead man if you leave
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out the warm and tender part
Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep
What's your name, my name is Pain
Where do you live, I live anyplace
Where were you born, in the state of fear
How old are you, nineteen hundred and ninety four years
What's your plan, my plan is pain
When will you leave, I'll never go away
How will you breathe, you'll give me life
How will you see, sitting in the temple right between your eyes
My name is Pain, you belong to me
You're all I wanted, I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning in a world without end
I am the air, I am Pain
Pain is love, Pain is pure
Pain is sickness, Pain is the cure
Pain is death, Pain is religion
Pain is life, Pain is television
Pain walks, Pain crawls
Pain is peace, Pain is war
Where were you born, in the state of fear
How old are you, nineteen hundred and ninety four years
My name is Pain, you belong to me
You're all I ever wanted, I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning in a world without end
I am the air, I am Pain
Deep inside my soul fights a war
I can't explain, I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire, and common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes
Belfast
Look outside, summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk on a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rocks and tanks go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place
Belfast
And it's sad when they sing, and hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses, on the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers from under the flowers
Every foot of this world needs an inch of Belfast
Who's to say on whom heaven smiles
Our different ways we try hard to recognise
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed and all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down
Belfast
The enemy is not at home
A jealous green streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver face
Belfast
Grey London morning, wet London streets
Rain on the window, wind in the trees
It's my time to write, it's your time to call
There's something about distance that gets to us all
Dark clouds above me, little people below
All walk with a purpose with someplace to go
It's my place to paint my own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas, it's just the weather and me
And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold strech of black across blue
Latitude
Cracks in the sidewalks, dogs on the run
An old poster reading "Give us your sons"
Window frames capture moments in time
But latitude captures the heart and the mind
We've been crippled in love, short changed, hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls a slogan or two about life
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down
So please, please, let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove
so please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you
We've been living with sorrow, been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings a little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down
But tied to the same track, the two of us look back
At oncoming trains ahead
How many more times can we lay on the line
Watching our love hang by a thread
Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat
Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man
Shakespeare's men got all the lines
Modern man lives back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel hands
Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
Man falls, cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief
He's the hoax behind the thrill
The poison arrow, the bitter pill
Hard to swallow, hard to kill, hard to understand
He's the light behind the hill
The broken promise, the iron will
Hard to kill, hard to understand
Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat
Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man
Shakespeare's men got all the lines
Modern man lives back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel hands
Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
Man falls, cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief
He's the hoax behind the thrill
The poison arrow, the bitter pill
Hard to swallow, hard to kill, hard to understand
He's the light behind the hill
The broken promise, the iron will
Hard to kill, hard to understand
Some lie about who they love
Some lie about the truth
Some lie to save their lives
Some lie about their youth
Some lie about age and beauty
The conquest of sex
Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a party dress
I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you
And we lie, lie, lie on a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie for that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something that sounds like the truth
Some lie in the face of death
Some lie about their fame
Some kneel and lie to God
Some lie about their name
Some lie in words and speeches
With every living breath
The young lie with their guitars
The old lie for a little respect
I've lied to lie with danger
I've lied for a drug or two
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you
I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you.
Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed
I know you're still just a dream
your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed
And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed
I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed
On and On
On and On
She broke my heart, he hurt me too
That's something that only unworthy souls do
They said goodbye, we say hello
An introduction for a perfect love to grow
Let's stop thinking about the past
And start thinking about the future
So that love can go on and on
Let's stop thinking about the past
And start thinking about the future
So that love can go on and on
She said she'd stay, he said that too
So sad when you find out your love has found a new
She made me cry, he made me weep
But life has love in store for us that's ooh so sweet
On and On (love keeps going on)
On and On (they've got the whole of life)
On and On (love keeps going on)
On and 
It's time to say goodbye to crying eyes and broken dreams
And get back to the joy that to each other we will bring
That starts from summer love to last through autumn, winter, spring
Our hearts will sing forever, love
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I got your picture hanging on my wall
But it can't seem to come to me
When I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters but you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear
I play my games of fantasy
I pretend I don't see reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of you being there
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
To make me feel better
Let's stay together
I'm so
So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet
I'll be yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet
Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet
Your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet
I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet
Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet
Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet an you hold my string, I'm your puppet
Yeah, I'm your puppet
Walking, talking, living, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string girl, I'll do anything now
I'm a walking, talking, living, loving puppet, and I love you
I'm a smiling happy face when you want me to
Even make you happy when you're feeling blue
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
Born to lose
I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you
Born to lose
Oh it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you're not there
Ooh you've grown tired and now you say we're through
I'm born to lose
And now I'm losing you
Born to lose
I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you
Born to lose
And now Elton I'm losing you
Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green
A face that smiled at every passing scene
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn
But you and I have come so far
With a shaken faith
From the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun
No more singing duets for one
I hold your picture here beside the bed
You had a party raging in your head
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn
I have this picture of me looking at you
Looking at me
And I would like to say
Goodbye sweet memory
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
I was lonely once in this great big world
Just a nowhere man without a girl
'Till that lucky day when she came my way
And she smiled at me as if to say
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
She's the only one, makes me feel so good
Can't believe my love so I knock on wood
All my silent fears seem to fly away
And she smiled at me as if to say
Your baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes for me
No more lonely nights just waiting for the telephone to ring
No more lonely days, my baby's taking care of everything
I'm telling you people
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
She's the only one, makes me feel so good
Can't believe my love so I knock on wood
All my silent fears seem to fly away
And she looked at me as if to say
When I was a little bitty baby
My Momma done rocked me in the cradle
In them old cottonfields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home
Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
I had to walk a long long way to town
Came along a nice old man
Well he had a hammer
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home
Oh let them cotton balls get rotten
I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cottonfields back home
Well it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I'd grown
In them old cotton fields back home
My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes you will be my pill
My Lady D'Arbanville
Why does it grieve me so
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low
My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes you will be my pill
My Lady D'Arbanville
You look so cold tonight
Your legs feel like winter
Your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white
My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes you will be my pill
My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you grieve me so
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low
I love you my lady
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die, this rose will never die
Sometimes I feel too old to work, too young to die
I'll drink my whisky, I'll keep smoking 'till I die
I wear a suit of sadness made by experience
I believe that in the end time will head what's nagging me
I'm a natural sinner, born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto, distrust everyone
I'm a natural sinner, born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto, distrust everyone
Remember _, now they're not hard to find
Now they ain't got no good side
There's nowhere in the world that I would rather be
Than with you my love
And there's nothing in the world that I would rather see
Than your smile my love
For united we stand
Divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, together, you and I
For united we stand
Divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, together, you and I
And if the world about you falls apart my love
Then I'll still be here
And if the going gets too hard along the way
Just you call, I'll hear
737 coming out of the sky
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band
Take me to the hotel
Baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on, won't you get me to the room
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band
Listen to the radio
Talking about the last show
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band
Here we come again on a Saturday night
With your fussing and your fighting, won't you get me to the right
I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band
Well I'm playing in a travelling band
Playing in a travelling band
Playing in a travelling band
Well I'm playing in a travelling band
Well I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band
And every time I get to thinking
Every thought of you I want to shout aloud
Then I think about the love I have inside me
How you brought what's inside out
Now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everthing I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You turned my living upside down
And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels
Is it cloudy, is it bright
Is it day or is it night
Am I wrong or am I right
And is it real
Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall
On and on I've drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so
You fed my life with love and much more besides
And you showed me which way to go
Good morning world, it's a brand new day
I'm packing my bags and I'm going away
I'm moving my legs and my city tired bones
I gotta get away from the busy man's phones
Gotta make a move where the living is wild and free
If you want to get happy them people come along with me
A fee fa fou fafafafa fouu
Run along boy, set a place for me
I'm getting so tired of the company
I'm getting __ looks from the big white man
I gotta get away just as fast as I can
Good morning freedom
Gotta break away
Gotta break away
Gotta break away
Good morning freedom
It's another day
It's another day
It's another day
Good morning freedom
A fee fa fou fafafafa fouu
__ is the same old game
A city tired living is the game to play
Loving thy neighbour is __
There's only one way to get the people to sing
Young, gifted and black
Oh what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black
Open your heart to what I mean
In the whole world you know
There's a million boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black
And that's a fact
Young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
This is a quest that's just begun
When you feel really low
Yeah, there's a great truth you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact
Young, gifted and black
How I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth
Oh but my joy of today
Is that we can all be proud to say
To be young, gifted and black
Is where it's at
In the summertime when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather's fine
You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a draft
Go out and see what you can find
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
Speed along the lane, do a __
When the sun goes down, you can make it, make it good and then they buy
We're not __ people, we're not dirty __
We love everybody, but we do as we please
When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go swimming in the sea
We're always happy, __ yeah that's our philosophy
Sing along with us, de de de-de-dee
Da da da-da-da, yeah we're hap-happy
Da da da-da-da-da-da da da-da da
Da da da-da-da-da-da da da-da da
When the winter's here, yeah it's party time
Bring you bottle, __ it'll soon be summertime
And we'll sing again, __ settle down
If she's rich, if she's nice, bring your friends and we'll all go into town
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're going
Leave the sinking ships behind
Come on __
We're going up around the bend
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon __ wood
You can ponder perpetual motion
__ your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for what you say
Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Come along, come along with me
I'm a neanderthal man
You're a neanderthal girl
Let's make neanderthal love
In this neanderthal world
I'm a neanderthal man
You're a neanderthal girl
Let's make neanderthal love
In this neanderthal world
I'm a neanderthal man
You're a neanderthal girl
Let's make neanderthal love
In this neanderthal world
I'm a neanderthal man
You're a neanderthal girl
Let's make neanderthal love
In this neanderthal world
If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money, sonny
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
Fool and his money, sonny
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can we do
Tears from your little sister
Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know she'll get by
'Cause she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it in the snow on the ground
Out walking your dog to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm
You can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can
Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You can take them in stride, for family pride
You know that faith in your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And a __ prayer making you strong
Where you belong
Where you can live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can
Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know has love
You have words with him
And your future's looking kind of dim
But these things
Your heart can rise above
Once in a while he won't call
Oh but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet "OK"
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
Come on sing it now
Do-do-do-do-do do doo, oh yeah
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
So long, boy you can take my place
I've got my papers, I've got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
To Yellow River
Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass high, the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love
Yellow River
Yellow River
Yellow River is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River
Yellow River is in my blood, it's the place I love
Got no time for explanations
Got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleeping underneath the moon
At Yellow River
Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad that I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time
From Yellow River
I remember the nights were cool
I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew
From Yellow River
Whenever I hear good-bye
Reminds me, baby, of you
I break down and cry
The next time I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance
Reminds me, baby, of you
I took a crazy chance
The next time I'll be true, I'll be true
Footsteps on the dance floor
Remind me, baby, of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the back room
She cries on every tune, every tune
And the music don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels
Like I felt it with you
When I'm dancing round
Reminds me, baby, of you
I won't let you down
The next time I'll be true, I'll be true
Holding all the pictures that my life's drawn
I never find I'm missing love
Remembering all parades that had been rained on
But never cloudy leaving love
Ask me what it is that makes it special
Why it's so real to me
It's knowing who keeps their place in my heart
It's knowing how is it I can feel you
It's knowing never will I change my mind
When I think about love I think about you
When I think about love I think about you
Too many times I've turned my emotions on and off
Without realizing what it does
I know what's moved me and kept me going this far
But I never questioned what it was
I have sold myself through and through
I have walked in the darkness too
Felt a red sun, the living proof
Washed my hands in the honest truth
I have carried this weight time after time
I have bettered the dumb and the blind
I've seen dignity fail and colours run
Seen justice denied by the voice of a gun
And we walk, yes we walk
And we walk with the power every day
Never letting the light slip away
Reaching out, reaching in
Touching truth and touching skin
Never letting the light slip away
And we walk with the power every day
If my faith is a fire then burn baby burn
We've held fire long enough to learn
Heat beneath hope is a healing light
Kept alive by the flames of night
Walk tall in the power day after day
Never, never, never lose sight of the way
See the dawn come and the dusk hang
See the power rise from an open hand
Lady luck and four leaf clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
`Til your leaving dampened the situation
Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Girl you better throw me a life preserver
`Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears
Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Shaking, shakey ground
Standing, standing
Standing on shakey ground
Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothing to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love forever, true
Love forever, true
Give me more true love
Oh yeah
True love, true love
Gotta give me your true love
Oh yeah
True love, true love
If you were me
And I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me
And I was you
If you were me
And I was you
What kind of crazy things
Would I have to do
Who likes to party
Who stays at home
If you were me
And I was you
Never like strangers
Though never the same
Two circus sideshows
That laughed in the rain
You stayed with the full moon
You searched for the stars
Thank God in His heaven
Here we both are
Where have you been are you still on my side
Is that love or regret that I see in your eyes
How many years have we played out this game
Every time we come close the answer's always the same
I guess some souls get restless under the skin
There's a shortage by half of marrying men
You know that I love you but I love to be free
So tell me what do you want, yeah from a gypsy like me
I need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice
One man to show me the best part of life
Is that what you want
Yeah, that's what I need
A home and a family makes sense for us
A solid foundation built out of trust
Do you think you can find that with someone like me
Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs
I've been shortchanged and cheated so many times
But you're all that I've wanted For all of my life
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself
I want to be good, I want to be strong
But I treated him bad, I've done him wrong
I've taken his money, I'm given him hell
And he takes it all 'cause he knows me well
We can say what we mean and mean what we say
We don't like to mess around
But we're there to hold each other up
When we're falling down
Just like an old friend
Putting me on my feet again
Giving me back my pride then
Letting me go
Just like an old friend
Putting me in my place again
Giving me back my hope then
Letting me know that he's an old friend
I don't suffer no fools *I testify*
But he must be one for being by my side
I've broken his heart
I've shaken his tree
But still he doesn't want anything from a fool like me
We won't talk for a year or two
Maybe when we do we won't say much
Even so we know that out of mind is never out of touch
We're having a man-to-man
Don't want to get sentimental
But both of us understand
We'll never have to say goodbye, just see you later
There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate
And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're gonna get back to the simple life again
When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop
I saw you dancing out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel
For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach
No ceiling on hard living
Peace keepers keep on breathing
Can't deny eye for eye
It's open season
Dictate to my reason
She devils ruling Britain
Hey girl stick it in your purse
Call it treason
Band aids on dead doorways
No heroes in the Bat Cave
Don't give me Tears For Fears
Give me tears of rage
Fires burn with black smoke
Oil slicks put us on the ropes
Man it's hard to handle
When the bank's broke
Don't kow-tow, don't bow down
Loosen up, get the lead out
Backs up let them shout
Backs up sweat it out
When your back's up, sweat it out
Backs up, sweat it out
Hope froze in the cold weather
No ice on a greasy river
Liberty and John Doe
Stand and Shiver
War waits when the lines form
The baby sitter in a uniform
Knocking down your door
For your rice and corn
There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways
Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows
And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train
Tonight it's hot down here
I can almost smell the rain
And I can almost taste the fear
Behind your name
Fans turning on the ceiling
I feel sticky as a chili dog
White boys howling in the evening
On that hollow log
Tall tales down the river
Say we aim to bury the truth
But the right hand just delivered
The devil in a suit
And he talks big in Whitewash County
Talks sweet as sugar cane
Got a past that's filled with lightning
Got a future filled with rain
Bug buzzing in an empty glass
Fiddle scratching some lazy tune
We're just some place that history passed
New dust, new broom
And it's a high hot buttered moon
He's got a shiny new wax face
Swears the South's gonna rise again soon
All over the place
Rain down on Whitewash County
Smell the air coming up the line
Well you've changed your face so often
But you never change your mind
Have you seen the North
That cold grey place
Don't want its shadow anymore
On my face
A man grows bitter
We're a bitter race
Some of us never get to see
A better place
In the Northern Skies
There was a steel cloud
It used to follow me around
But I don't see it now
There's a farm in the rain
And a little farmhouse
There were a young man's eyes
Looking south
The North was my mother
But I no longer need her
You trade your roots and your dust
For a face in the river
And a driven rain that washes you
To a different shore
There's a North in us all
But my North can't hold me anymore
She may be lost
She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found
But in her woman's way
She's still a little girl
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
Oh well the choice is hers
`Cause you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you
Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh when strength is kind
And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home
The church bells ring out morning glory
When summer bends to the winter's rage
Emily walks through the cemetery
Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
Talks to her sisters in the ground
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
I heard a prophesy all around
And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down
Emily prays to a faded hero
In a little frame clutched to her gown
Hears the voice of promise in his memory
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down
In a cage sits a gold canary
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom
As a soul ascends abord the evening
Canary sings to an empty room
And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down
I'm staring down a mile of disappearing track
Is this the best that we could do
I'm leaning through the rain but you ain't looking back
What did I ever have to prove
`Cause it feels like electricity hitting an open field
When am I ever gonna to learn
Married life's two people trying to grab the wheel
Oh and we must have got lost
Living on Dark Street
Looking for an exit
Sleeping on the concrete
You can't see it with your eyes
You can't find it with your feet
All I know is that we're lost baby
And we're living on Dark Street
All the layoffs and the pay cuts cripple me inside
I pay the price for living everyday
Trying to keep us all together along with a little pride
What'll it take to make you stay
But I've dreamed about an island
And all I got's a bucket of sand
I'd give my eyes to give you all your dreams
Rolling over trying to sleep
And understanding women
Thinking of you out there somewhere
Looking for a new beginning
Just let me be the final word
In the book we haven't written
I won't be another page
In understanding women
I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven
How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women
And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
And I'm not any man you've ever known before
Don't judge this picture by the frame
Every man is not the same
Some men reach beyond the pain
Of understanding women
Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm
`Cause I never thought I'd lose
I only thought I'd win
I never dreamed I'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess I misjudged love
Between a father and his son
Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free
I won't see you `till Christmas
I breathe coal dust, I get blisters
But the foreman he don't worry
He say work boy there's no hurry
Don't that big red sun
Look a lot like fire
When you come out of the ground
After forty eight hours
Going down down down down down
Going down in Durban deep
Going down down down down down
There's no mercy in my sleep
I just hear that drill and hammer
I feel the killing heat
Going two miles down to the heart
Of Durban deep
I was born on amen corner
I pound rock face, I get lonely
But my family they go hungry
Sill the boss man he call us lazy
Don't the old blue heaven
Look a lot like your eyes
When you're blinded by the brightness
Of the Transvaal sky
I never dreamed I could cry so hard
That ain't like a man
I could fly like a bird some days
Had a place where I could land
I could have sworn we were all locked in
Ain't that what you said
I never knew it could hurt so bad
When the power of love is dead
But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again
And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands
I never knew love like poison
That burned like a fire
All I ever wanted was a reason
To drown in your eyes
I never knew sleep so restless
Empty arms so cold
That's not the way it's supposed to be
It ain't the spell that I was sold
Look at me twice with wildcat eyes
Promise me everything except a blue night
Shudder like ice in cut crystal glass
Melt in embraces of crazy eyed past
And whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
Tantamount to a lie with lingering breath
Walking fingers run, hungry scratches left
Dull chimes ringing like an empty voice
A distant smile framed, her lips are soft and moist
With whispers, whispers, whispering whispers
And whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers, leave me alone
With your whispers, whispers, whispering whispers
With whispers, whispers, whispering whispers
When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand
There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays
That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Oooh where we meet
Oooh where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye
In this smoky room
There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light
There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
Lord have mercy
You can't sit still
You can't sit still
Help me information
Get emotion on the line
This war that's raging in my heart's
Getting harder all the time
Our painted smiles are cracking
Our worried friends just frown
We got a runaway train on an empty track
That's trying to run us down
And I'm a stone's throw from hurtin'
Everything we put together
Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever
I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw
A stone's throw from hurtin'
And I know it's never gonna get no better
Crippled conversation hangs inside this house
Our voices just get ugly
When our love gets all talked out
Your goodnight kiss ain't hungry
Our touches don't connect
We're just a couple of kids with a broken toy
That our idle fingers wrecked
Some things get broken
When stones get thrown
Some things get better
When you leave what you love
And you let what you love alone
Some things get broken
When stones get thrown
Some things get better when you leave what you love
And let what you love alone
Like a thief he's come, like a thief he's gone
He's stolen your tears one by one
You're proud to love him, it's a foolish sign
You're a broken heart at the scene of the crime
And the night drags on, and the fever burns
Come to your senses, everybody learns
You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
You're an empty doll in the power of a fool
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between
If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
It's an echo of pain on common ground
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back
But he takes love and he turns it cold
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
But he sees you and he runs from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
And he'll hurt you
And he'll run from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
Well she swept through the church
Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang Son of Heaven
And the groom just walked on air
I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man
And she walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name
Oh the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name
In the shadow of the holy
Oh I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last
Oh the preacher with his blessing
Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life
You're a cool little one
My dark southern breeze
Sweeps through my fingers
And it amazes me
Dixie shadowland
Your envy shelters me
Lay down your burden
Mystery of ebony
And it amazes me
Oh it amazes me
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon
Look up that pale light
Well she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me
That magnolia state
Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company
Ain't no magic potion
No gri-gri on her side
She's bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes me
I gotta quit this habit
It's like some drug for you
You've been my sweet sweet addict
I've been your little white boy blue
You've got the same obsession
We ain't no cat and mouse
You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house
And it's no use each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe
Up on Blue Avenue
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue
Two hearts get entangled
Dirty minds they go to town
Everyone's got an angle
Little lies get spread around
Let them say what they want
You and me we already knew
Takes more than hocus pocus babe
To save you from Blue Avenue
I'll say it again this is not my city
I don't belong looking for a town of plenty
There weren't these thieves
We had some thing in common
Goals to achieve
We had some thing in common
In a town of plenty
Can't you see it, this is not my writing
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
I came looking for a town of plenty
I'll say it again, this is not my city
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty
I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost
If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen
And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish
If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist
When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue
I used to think that New York City
Fell from grace with God
And innocence abroad
Waged a war for the underdog
When the snow falls
And Central Park looks like a Christmas card
I just looked beyond the bagman
And the madness that makes this city hard
I heard a basketball
Somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
Inner city prisoners
Argue for the right of self-defense
But there's a fast break
And every work of art wakes something in the soul
Just focus on the brush strokes
And the bouquets that the dancers hold
Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city that
That took away the kid in me
I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
Something tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five
I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carving up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits
`Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze
And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
`Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Oh if you wanna spread it around sister that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light
Outside I can hear the fireworks
Beyond the paper walls
Where the symbols painted black and white
Run together when the rain falls
And the wind chimes across Kyoto
Each time the earth moves
Was it the quake that shook me
Or was it something to do with you
And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds
And your almond eyes always shine
Sitting cool behind your painted fan
All the secrets of the east
Conceal the beauty and the beast
For tender is the man in her Japanese hands
Flesh on silk looks different
Than on a cotton sheet back home
Where no one wears their hair like yours
Beneath those oriental combs
And with your thirsty fingers
Running up and down my spine
You forget the western woman
When you're sleeping on Kyoto time
And the sky explodes
and the moon grows cold
To the distant sound of drums
And the sky explodes
And the moon grows cold
As the dragons on the mainland
Wait to heat the sun
Say goodbye to loneliness, say goodbye to Marlon Brando
Say goodbye to latitudes and the confusion that surrounds you
Say goodbye to misery, say goodbye to the morning news
Say goodbye to prime time and the fools that choose to view
Say goodbye to Wendy, say goodbye to Rhonda
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys from the Palisades to Kona
Say goodbye to Glasnost, say goodbye to Malathion
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress and the belt around Orion
Say goodbye to the tabloids, say goodbye to diet soda
Say goodbye to new age music from the Capa to the Coda
Say goodbye to gridlock, goodbye to Dolly's chest
Goodbye to the ozone layer if there's any of it left
Don't it make you wanna crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me, me
Say goodbye to Jackie Collins, say goodbye to illiterate fools
Goodbye to evangelists and geeks with power tools
Goodbye to statuettes, say goodbye to lists
Say goodbye to articles on who the senator kissed
Say goodbye to hair styles, goodbye to heaven's gate
Goodbye to Rocky Five, Six, Seven and Eight
I see you tempt the night
I see you take a bite
You can tell me you were home
But the camera never lies
You walk out in disguise
To pull the wool over my eyes
You play me for a fool
To believe your alibis
And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies
There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies
I recommend first prize
For acting so surprised
For acting like you love me
The camera never lies
I'll take my wounded pride
I'll take it on the chin
Your profile fills the frame
How good you look on film
Smoke screens and sweet deceiving
Replace the face of trust
The shutter falls each time you meet him
A negative becomes my plus
Shakey wake up thirsty from a night in the bar
And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard
The pimp from the Jack of Diamonds
Just got another Jane Doe
She just got off the last bus from Montecedo
Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate
Fly boys on the corner waiting for a ride
For twenty bucks he'll pull the cork on the man inside
`Cause we're rolling in heavy traffic
Judy's in the jump seat and Jody's in the bucket
Billy likes to drive and Jackie's just high
And Cindy thinks we're all gonna commit suicide
`Cause we're rolling in heavy traffic
Yeah we're rolling in heavy traffic
Mack he's got his Marlboros tucked up in his sleeve
He's shacked up in his basement making P.C.P.
He used to shake the french fries
Down on 12th and Maine
And now he stays up nights on apple juice and cocaine
There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls
And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
`Cause she hates those Texas girls
Poor cow
You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you
In the back of his hand
Poor cow
It's a monkey see town
You'll walk down the aisle
In the hand me down gown
Of some poor cow
Oh them rich bitch girls
Ain't like our lass
Got no spine for labour
Like us working class
Us gamey lot
Still got our pride
We got our health
It's just the truth that's died
The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear
Longer in the seam
Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space
Yeah they got competition now
All across the world
But there ain't been no looking back
Since God invented girls
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls
Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan
Oh here's a little heat boys
To straighten out them curls
Now there ain't been no angels round
Since God invented girls
Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a forty five
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the after life
And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Play back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day
We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home
Be a cool jerk, don't work
When fashion makes you change
Keep the faith, don't waste
Another nickel on another name
And idolise twisted cars
Like taxi cabs and spiders
Eternity's just down the road
They're looking for more riders
You say that all you want are the simple things
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire
And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
No late nights making love in secret places
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire
She's a real ball-buster, don't trust her
She's in a most peculiar phase
You can rear end her oh it'll send her
She wants you, she'll have you her own way
Don't untie her, don't defy her
`Cause she'll bring you down to your knees
You can beat her but don't mistreat her
Oh don't believe that woman please
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
`Cause she'll burn you
Turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman boys
`Cause she'll hurt you
And turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman boys
She's a man-eater, oh don't you cheat her
She'll cut you just to watch you bleed
A woman half crazy, oh then again lazy
With an appetite to feed
She's a liar oh you can't buy her
`Cause she'll bring you down to your knees
Don't untie her, don't defy her
Oh don't believe that woman please
Mean sister, tongue-twister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard
Soul sister, two-fister
She takes it easy but she makes it hard
It's so hard to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to give
When this house is just a hill of bones
Where you and I once lived
If we put it back together
By the skin of our teeth
You'd still pull it all apart
Bit by bit, piece by piece
And I'll go it alone
Call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick
Till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you
There's no passion alive
When you count your phony schemes
And the cars you drive to buy your friends
They don't ever come back clean
If the cards on the table
Always turn up spades
The cards that always cheat the hearts
The spades you play just dug my grave
The weather man he looks confused
Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do
But you don't remember things like that do you
The balance was uneven but I'm breaking through
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold
The winter here don't believe in God
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog
I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog
But one foot in your door oh that's all I ever got
Chances are you'll reappear
Swim my way in a flood of tears
No place to hide your conscience so
You're a sinking ship with no place to go
Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
sitting on the window sill
And it's a wild Friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There ain't one little girl that's home
And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend honey
When your heart's on fire
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache, heartache all over the world
He's got lipstick on his collar
She's got fishnets on her legs
I'm at home and I've got nothing
Just a cold and aching head
There must be something dirty
Just blame it on the magazines
Don't read that trash it'll drive you crazy
`Cause the cops invade your dreams
And everybody's got a date
And the one's that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend honey
When your heart's on fire
Well I'm work shy, I'm wild-eyed
So shut that door when the baby cries
And keep me well fed, give me warm bread
Lay my body on a feather bed
And spoil me, Angeline
Get to work when the whistle screams, Angeline
Maybe someday, some way
Somewhere in the future there's more pay
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash
And bite me, Angeline
Let me use you like a sex machine, Angeline
You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean
Well I talk tough, I act rough
Lay still honey I can't get enough
And keep your nose clean, let me be
On your knees when you speak to me
And trust me, Angeline
And talk real dirty and I'll make you scream Angeline
Here am I, standing by
To see if you still love me
Why conceal, you still feel
The need to push and shove me
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
More than just a memory of
Love will grow, it comes and goes
Emotions can deceive you
Well this I vow, here and now
My love will never never never leave you
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
Ours for all eternity
Promise it will always be
More than just a memory of love
Nobody left in the airport lounge
They cleaned the ashtrays
TV's just wound down
I've got to wait till morning
I've got to last the night
I've only got one book
To see me through my flight
But when I get to Paris
We'll paint all our portraits
In brush-strokes of yellow
And christen the canvas
The left bank is crying
For colour to crown it
Like the roof of a palace
We'll drink in the amber
When I get to Paris
You were the best of Montmartre Street life
You signed the tablecloth
Art has its price
It's so hard to hold on
To the ghost of your breed
It takes ambition
To call the colours you need
I've got to wait till morning
I've got to last the night
I've only got one book
To see me through the flight
Without you I no longer swim upstream
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between
The red letter days and all the pain
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed
And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision
Hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely
When the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time
When I fall apart
Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away
I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her I'll give her three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me
It's closing time the boys are all together at the bar
Staring in their glasses
Looks like another layoff at the yard
Yesterday I heard union hall come down
They hit it with a wrecking ball
And they try but nothing changes in this town
Cap in hand stood in line
Your family ties are the chains that bind
The endless wheel goes round and round
Chances are you'll never leave this town
Oh oh no
Like a river now the empty streets are flooded out with rain
It's falling on the playground
While the kids get wet playing the same old games
Locked away so many things remind them of war
They tap the pavement with their canes
The good old days ain't so good no more
I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
But the kids just watch the storm
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse
Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war
You say today was not so easy
Pressure tends to get the best of you
Well don't let them break your spirit
Keep the faith and you will come on through
And I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands
And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Never take it off
And baby if the seam's rough
And honey if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh like a soul glove
Look at me don't you believe me
Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
To shave in someone else's mirror
Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet
But I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands
Hey Nikita is it cold
In your little corner of the world
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow
Oh Nikita You will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know
Do you ever dream of me
Do you ever see the letters that I write
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend
Your mother's eyes look straight through me
Whenever we meet
Your father swears it'll never be
As long as he breaths
And how many times have they told you
That you're too young
How, how I've ached to hold you
But you're too young
If we don't buy what's right or wrong
Then we are sinners
We were never two to tag along
But we were always winners
And how many people, have told you
That you're too young
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you
`Cause you're too young
Well you're too young to love me
And I'm too old for you
At least that's what they tell us
It's in their book of rules
That you're too young, too young baby you're too young
We could try it for a while
But they'd get us in the long run
They say that you're too young, baby you're too young
There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisa's, well connected
They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turned up noses
Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached
She's a honey, she's a tramp
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up
Give her to me, wrap her up
Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven
You pretty babies, from Paris, France
Crazy horses, love to dance
Well you come on like a comet, ideas in your head
Starving for affection, waiting to be fed
Crazy like a full moon, eyes open wide
Taking in everything you need to stay alive
Who leads who, who knows where
If you leave me now will I see you again
I'm telling you love bites
Like a satellite
Going round and round
It's something, something you can't fight
Oh in the daylight
And even in the dark night
I want you to surround me
Surround me like a satellite
Oh you move like a shadow of your own design
Do you want to trap me in between the lines
I don't walk on water if you think I can
If you want a miracle call up a Superman
Are we there
Is this love
Is this a space race
That we're both part of
I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
At least that's what the papers say
Coal mines closed down
Nobody's working underground today
More jails, peace for sale
Japanese still killing whales
Teen dreams
On two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say
I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
Least that's what the papers say
Dope and pills, guns kill
Death just buys cheap thrills
Coal mines, closed down
Nobody's working underground today
Teen dreams, on two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say
Well I'm keeping off the streets since you came to town
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found
I have said goodbye to my fooling around
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound
You and me babe we got candy by the pound
Well I never knew it could feel so good
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound
Oh with you underneath it's like candy by the pound
With you underneath it's like candy by the pound
You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound
Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh wow I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound
Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense
Hiding from the claws of my old girl friend
She's screaming murder beating my door down
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound
Oh no I don't want it
You can take it all
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Put your suitcase in the hall
Oh you robbed me blind
Of what little hope remained
You put a gun to my head
A bullet through my brain
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is
You're guilty at the scene of the crime
I never say more than I need
The mystery runs deep
The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep
This ain't no battle honey, this ain't no fight
How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
If I take a drink, is that against the law
And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war
Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
And if you think it's easy to forget about me
You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war
We're living on the front line you and me
Fighting on this battleground of misery
Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
And we'll make this an act of war
Give it all you've got `cause I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war
Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours ain't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war
Well if that's your game then honey two can play
I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
Ain't no way baby this girl's gonna stay
I call it, I call it an act of war
And it looks like time ain't been on our side
If we could turn the clock back
We might survive this act of war
This ain't no battle honey, this ain't no fight
How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
If I take a drink, is that against the law
And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war
Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
And if you think it's easy to forget about me
You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war
We're living on the front line you and me
Fighting on this battleground of misery
Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
And we'll make this an act of war
Give it all you've got `cause I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war
Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours ain't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war
Well if that's your game then honey two can play
I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
Ain't no way baby this girl's gonna stay
I call it, I call it an act of war
And it looks like time ain't been on our side
If we could turn the clock back
We might survive this act of war
Hey there Georgie got a couple of things to say
One you're my friend, and two it's hurting me
Seeing you act this way
But my hands are tied and I can only try to talk you out of a fall
`Cause the reputation of the woman you're dating's
About as nasty as the Berlin wall
Slow down Georgie she's poison
Man you've got to watch yourself
She's gonna get in your head, she's gonna crawl in your bed
You're just a stepping stone for someone else
Slow down Georgie she's poison
She's just another divorcee
An undercover lover of a hundred
Other little fish in the sea
You better cut her loose before she gets her hooks in you
If you give her the world, and it was covered in pearls
She'd only ask for the moon
She's got you hypnotised, with her big brown eyes
And a body that could stop a clock
But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced
Georgie boy you're in for a shock
Well it ain't my job to rain on your parade
But if the chips were down, you'd do the same for me
It's always been that way
She's got you paralysed with a pack of lies
About honour and the single girl
And if you buy that line you must be out of your mind
You must be living in another world
There's a light on in your window
There's a shadow on the street
Two silhouettes tell me it's over
The shadow knows the shadow's me
I won't crawl or cause you trouble
Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
But before I leave your life completely
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling
Lord knows the days just get longer
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
And I feel like an old jukebox
Playing the same song all the time
If these crazy dreams don't kill me
It's more than I can take from you
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes
My friends all say don't got to pieces
I say that's fine but if I lose
I want to know who's in my foot steps
I want to know who wears these shoes
My friends all think I must be crazy
I see the facts but if it's true
I want to know who's in my footsteps
I want to know who wears these shoes, darling
Oh and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do
When I face the two of you
She looked so easy `cause she looked so young
With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
And the luck of the Irish on her side
Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
She's got her price, she can turn on a dime
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
Look a little closer, that's acid rain
And I don't know
Why li'l frigerator you're so cold
Go li'l frigerator go
Get away from my soul
Li'l frigerator you're so cold
She's calculated with the kiss of death
Got a digital mind and expensive breath
She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat
Just another statistic on her readout sheet
They used to say that boys are tough as nails
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail
Now things have changed, I feel so old
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals
I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile
It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all I treated each and every one like dirt
Who wants a heart that's never home
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Deny the passenger, who want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on
Want to get on
He want to get on
To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail
Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
It's tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train
The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line
Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Behind the counter she stares out the window
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door
In neon, in neon
Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something
She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up in neon
In neon
It used to be a sweet sensation
No price too high for love
Now I pay for this bitter taste
And the price is not enough
Such cruel sport for your kicks
Such hard knocks on my heart
How long before the pain ends
Tell me where living starts
And lovers leap off burning buildings
Waking up on a sky high wire
Desperation leaves us clinging
On the edge of a house on fire
Lovers leap off burning buildings
Live our life on borrowed time
Every flame that ever moved you
Touched your lips but never mine
Lovers leap off burning buildings
No room for conversation
Cold stares and angry words
Fall in pieces from our faces
We read "do not disturb"
Some lovers just go hungry
Others beg for just a bite
You use me under pressure
To whet your appetite
Sling your hook in with him baby
He's a real sharp-shooter now
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
Tell him I said he was a coward
This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how
Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyse
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line
Did he shoot her with a 45
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine
Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
He's living in the head of someone else
But better take him down and dust him honey
I want to hear the truth for myself
Did he shoot her
Did he shoot her
We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds
It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart
And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year
The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year
I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf
But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines
Where's the beauty in the beast we made
Why the frost in the summertime
Six o'clock alarm
I get the wake up call
Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall
I'm too low for zero
I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt
I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
Cutting out cups of coffee
Switching off the late night news
Putting the cat out two hours early
It isn't any use
I'm too low for zero
Insomnia attacks
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise
It's daylight when I hit the sack
Well he could almost taste the money
But he was sitting in a den of thieves
Looking for the great awakening
Trying to find a way to leave
But that's when he got religion
And the light went on inside
He said somebody up there likes me
Now he's working for the holy guide
He got drunk but he don't remember
That he'd been drinking in a bar downtown
When he thought he heard a choir of angels
Singing in the Tiki Lounge
And that's when he got religion
From no salesman on TV
Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot
He still drinks but he does believe
Religion, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
Religion, oh you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
She was silent as he paid her
But the thanks she got was next to none
And as her car pulled out of the motel
She felt the presence of someone
And that's when she got religion
In the front of a compact Ford
Just a gentle voice on the stereo
Now she's a working girl who loves the lord
We're caught up in a web, you and I
Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever
In the long run she's the one who must decide
And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there
Oh Crystal
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal
You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars
Well she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed
I should have stuck up my hand
I should have got up to stand
And this is what I should have said
I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
Long before she met him
She was mine, mine, mine
Don't say I do
Say bye, bye, bye
And let me kiss the bride yeah!
Underneath her veil I could see a tear
Trickling down her pretty face
And when she slipped on the ring I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom would have known he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did
And what I planned to say
Yeah on her wedding day
Well I thought it but I kept it hid
You're cruel, you do
You do, you do me wrong
You hurt me, you flirt with
Any old face that comes along
But I won't be your whipping boy
No I won't be your whipping boy
Break me like a little toy
Run me till my feet are sore
But I won't be your whipping boy
You're wild, you're sly
What you done to me
I was thirty, I look like fifty
But I feel like sixty three
It's this illegal kind of loving
That keeps my motor running
From the start to the finish line
It's a trashy kind of me that likes to believe
That I'm still trying, I'm still trying
I'm still trying, yes I'm trying
You're dirty, but you're worth it
But you're way, you're way too young
I could do time if they found out
Look out, San Quentin here I come
You don't pass your time in limbo
Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl
Who took the wrong road into town
But you got that short cut way about you
And no one's gonna stare you down
You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down
And heaven can wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me
My baby's a saint
My baby's a saint
I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through
And you traded in your luck for survival
To sweeten up the witch's brew
You had a better way of working magic
A little mystery in your eyes
Instead of rolling over you remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise
He said I want to grow up
And look like Robert Mitchum
And I hope that when I'm gone
There'll be some say that I miss him
He must have been romantic
He must have sensed adventure
And I feel the steel of his strong will
In the frame around his picture
And he's one more arrow flying through the air
One more arrow landing in a shady spot somewhere
Where the days and nights blend into one
And he can always feel the sun
Through the soft brown earth that holds him 
Forever always young
He could have been a boxer
But the fight game seemed so dirty
We argued once he knocked me down
And he cried when he thought he'd hurt me
Strictly from the old school
He was quiet about his pain
And if one in ten could be that brave
I would never hate again
One more arrow
One more arrow
One more arrow
Forever always young
I got home today
Took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine
She could not be found
All her things were gone
She just left a note
It don't take no mastermind
To figure what she wrote
And she said dear John I'm moving on
By this time I'm gonna be long gone
Dear John c'est la vie
Dear John so long
You've seen the last of me
I don't want her back
I won't even try
This time ain't just au revoir
This time it's goodbye
We could not go on
Living like we were
I was just about to write
A Dear John note to her
I was gonna say
Dear John I'm moving on
By this time I'm gonna be long gone
Dear John c'est la vie
Dear John so long
You've seen the last of me
I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part
Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child
I've turned the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child
You'd better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete
Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
Turn the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child
I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise
I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do...
I'm singing do do do...
You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out
Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby
I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise
I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love
So I'm gonna quit this game `cause baby I've had enough
Your accountant called this morning
There was springtime in his heart
He couldn't wait to tell me
How he'd pulled our lives apart
And the letter from your lawyer
Lies unopened on the tray
I may get around to reading it later today
Walking round the lonely rooms
I see everything the same
But suddenly it matters
What was purchased in my name
Whether this or that was paid for
Belongs to me or you
Can the seven years together be divided by two
It says something for the legal boys
But nothing much for us
That all we had together
Is so quickly ended thus
The legal boys have won again
And you and I have lost
They can't tell us how it happened
But they'll let us know the cost
Oh they'll let us know the cost, oh yeah
There's a lot I'd like to tell you
But I can't get past your guards
I do not speak their language
And they hold all the cards
I would rather call you darling
Than defendant in the case
But lovers left here long ago
And clients took their place
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the morning comes
I'll be far away
And I say
Blue eyes
Holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me
Blue eyes
I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see
Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again
What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain
And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace
And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear
Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name
Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden
Haven't you heard what's new
There is a rumour
Going around that suddenly I've found you
Better believe it's true
I got a feeling
This is for real and nobody else will do
You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile
You are my princess
You are the one
You make the sun shine on me
You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess
Haven't you heard them say
I was a prisoner
Buried alive now suddenly I've been freed
But love is the sweetest way
Oh I was lonely
And now you're the only lover that I'll ever need
See the changes here on every street
As time goes marching to a different beat
Moving on into the restless age
As the kids today find their feet
(Long enough to hold on)
Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings
Oh won't somebody tell me
Tell me where have all the good times gone
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you
(Yeah we had a good time)
Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past
Love has changed but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you
They've gone away
Gone they've gone away
Gone they've gone away
They've gone away
It's hard enough to lose the game
And sad to see it played again
What makes you happy for a while
Is gonna make you smile through the rain
Won't you please tell me where have all the good times gone
All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force
All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front
So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands
It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise
I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out
I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine
I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You gotta go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You gotta give if you wanna get
And I want all you got
I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place, it's all in the game
If you're doing fine boy, you got my vote
But step out of line boy and I'll go for your throat
'Cause I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote
I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers you won't recognise
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place now and again
My heart's in the right place, know what I mean
My heart's in the right place on page seventeen
I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place, it's part of the skill
Heart's in the right place
I'm gonna destroy you and your reputation
Don't count for nothing with me
'Cause I'm an old bitch you see and my heart's in the right place
Don't you agree
Heart's in the right place, just wait and see
Heart's in the right place, don't you agree
Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs
But the red lights where the catfights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium
Just like a hustler when they look attractive
It's nothing more than a slap on the back
The price tag of being just a little bit different
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance
They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretence
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins
They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears
We used to love each other once
With all the passion we possessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we learn from what we see
And face the truth while we still can
Then though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on
I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtlesque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.
And all that political crap
`Cause I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff
If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through
How come you're so understanding
When I tell you all my lies
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe
How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend
Chloe, Chloe
Chloe, what you gonna do about me
Chloe, what you gonna do
What you gonna do about me
You're the lifeline that I cling to
When I feel like giving in
When the dreams that I rely on
Start to wear a little thin
Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe, Chloe
Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
How come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind
You don't deserve that treatment, I can't pretend I was that nice
I'm no E ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
I'm a day behind your restless wings
You, you rather have the wealth of kings
Me, I'd rather be on the heels of the wind
Staring all alone
And your grace and style
Cut me to the bone
With your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you
I love your gypsy hair
And dark brown eyes
Always unprepared
For your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you
If you only knew
What I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed
To say your name
It's hard to grin and bear
When you're standing there
My lips are dry
I catch your eye and look away
Sitting in my room
I've got it bad
Crying for the moon
They think I'm mad
They say it isn't real
But I know what I feel and I love you
But I would give my life
For a single night beside you
Being wiry and thinking loudly
About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do
So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road
Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair
And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
'Cause I am the fox, like it or not
I'm always gonna be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox
It may sound crazy but it's often lonely
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while
Then you can use them, and you often fool them
Into believing whatever you desire
So I'll keep moving through the night
The hunter and the hunted
On their designated flights
I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown
I'm chasing the crown till he bites the apple
I was licking my lips till his Son come down
I'm chasing the crown, the crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown
I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock them
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing the crown
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout "Hey I'm chasing the crown"
Oh little Jeannie, you got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes and give it to the likes of me
Oh little Jeannie, she got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can, you make me all a man can be
And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh little Jeannie, you were always someone's fool
Little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years, you still retain the fears of youth
Oh little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast, searching for some lasting truth
And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh Jeannie, I will always be your fool
And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh oh Jeannie, I'm still in love with you
Stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie I'm so in love with you
Stepped into my life from a bad dream
You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost of your own
You've got the knack of being so laid-back
It's like talking to the great Unknown
You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hairdo
Pretty certain that you've got it made
Oh your life-style shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade
Sing it
Don't you wanna play this game no more
Don't you wanna play no more
Don't you wanna play this game no more
Don't you wanna play no more
You remain the only main contender
Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
Adamant before the fall
Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed
Don't you wanna play this game no more
When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed
Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line
But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world
Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried
Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world
Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together the two of them were mining gold
Dust settles on a thin cloud
Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd
I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours
Staring at a line of white powder
High-priced madness pays the tab
I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag
I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
A touch too much of white powder
And she's a habit I can't handle
For a reason I can't say
I'm in love with a wild white lady
She's as sweet as the stories say
White powder white lady
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house won't you
And hit this boy again
Shock waves to a tired brain
Sends that hungry lady to my door again
She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain
Entertaining white powder
I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
I might just escape while the others might die
Riding on a high of white powder
Dear God, are you there
Can you hear me, do you care
Dear God, here are we
Less than perfect, far from free
Oh we take what we get and we don't take no more
But we sometimes forget what it was you created us for
Dear God, now's the time
If you're listening, show some sign
Dear God, hear me plead
Don't desert us in our need
Dear God, lend a hand
Is this really what you planned
Dear God, in you we trust
Though we've failed you, don't fail us
Oh we take what we get but we can't take much more
Do you sometimes forget what it was you created us for, dear God
I hope and pray you'll lead us to a brighter day
Out of the darkness and light up our way, dear God
I hope and pray you'll lead us to a better way
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
Light up our way dear God, dear God
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
Never meant to be so friendly
Never made the room look nice
Never heed a word of warning
Never take my own advice
I got a brand-new problem
Pretty and she's 5 foot 10
I been in love three times this week
I'm just about to fall again
I don't want to fall in love
Never gonna fall in love, again
I don't want to fall in love
Never gonna fall in love
I'm never gonna fall in love, again
Never meant to be so sexist
It's so hard to overcome
Trying hard to fight the feeling
Lechery can be such fun
`Cause everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on
`Cause everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on
If you want my loving take me back
If you miss my touch little girl take me back
When the dreams you lean on are beginning to crack
Open up your heart little girl and take me back
If you want my loving then take me back
If you're on your own little girl take me back
When the nights grow longer turning blacker than black
Open up your heart little girl and take me back
Playing a part you're well prepared for, there you stand
With all I ever cared for in your hand
I'm waiting all the time
For some kind of sign from you
And I'll go on and on this way
Waiting for the day
When I will hear you say
You'll take me back
If you want my loving well take me back
If you're feeling down little girl
Then you'll take me back
When you look around you for the love that you lack
Open up your heart little girl
You got my heart little girl
Make a start little girl
And say you'll take me back
Take me back
You've been crying, and I'm crazy about you
I've been lying, and hanging you up, `cause
I'm deep on the inside, but flash on the outside
I am the thunder, and you are my lightning
Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, give me the key to your heart
Months of watching, and hours of hoping
That you'd want me, when you see me again
For I am an eagle, but my wings are all tied up
You got the power to fly me again
You've been trying to build walls all around you
But you're lying, `cause I've already been through
And I've seen you trying to capture that feeling
But you're chasing what you've never believed in
Tell me you love me, tell me you need me
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go go Johnny B. Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track
An engineer could see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, how that little country boy could play
His mother told him, someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
And maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight
City boy, city girl
Arm in arm in our city world
A lot of love, a lot of hope
Hope our love don't go up in smoke
I feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine
Warm love in a cold world
Warm love in a cold world
Hope we're gonna make it
Hope we're gonna make it
Warm love in a cold world
Warm love in a cold world
Girl we gotta make it
Girl we gotta make it
Warm love in a cold world
sure we're gonna make it
Sure we're gonna make it
Sure we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Never knew, but thanks to you
I'm finding out just what love can do
You picked me up, I've come alive
I'm seeing life in another light
Feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine
You've been crying
And there ain't no use denying
It was me
Who put you through this misery
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's gonna change me
Baby, that's the way I am
I was born bad
Always been the same, yes I was born bad
Never gonna change 'cause I was born bad
Only me to blame 'cause I was born bad
Yes I was born bad
Always been my habit, I was born bad
Just can't seem to help it, I was born bad
Always gonna happen, I was born bad
'Cause I was born bad
I mistreat you
And you know I always cheat you
But that's me
And that's the it's always been
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's gonna change me
Baby, that's the way I am
Ain't no loving tonight
My woman says she ain't my woman
I sure put up a fight
To keep it right
I used a whole lot of pride to get her
I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
She just threw me the key
and said she's free
Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again
Frightening lightning hit me again
It's burning much deeper this time
I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head
And it's gonna rain harder this time
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder
Out here searching the streets
I gotta find my woman and tell her
I never wanted to cheat
But she cheated me
I never knew just how much I loved her
I never knew till I went and lost her
Now it's all too late
She's gone away
Night life, hot spot light
I've gotta make them dance tonight
Night life, hot spot light
I really want to shine tonight
Night life, hot spot light
I gotta steal a heart tonight
Night life, hot spot light
I'll show them how to dance tonight
I know that the competition's heavy
I know that these guys are cool
But I'll show this kid is more than ready
I sure got something to prove
Right now I'm just another guy
I don't mean nothing to them
but when they see me dance
When they see me dance
Right now the music's moving higher
I feel them stepping up the beat
These shoes will set the floor on fire
Everybody on your feet
You thought that you'd seen the best
Well I can tell you, forget the rest
When you see me dance
When you see me dance
Street guys, walking, dancing
Sidewalk, music, hot thing
They got their boxes tuned into their favorite show
As they truck on down the road
Is that the radio
Yes that's the radio
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie gonna set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie, on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie, street boogie, street boogie, street boogie
Traffic, skater, rolling
Sharing, music, sure thing
He got his shoulder holster turned a way up loud
As he wheels his way around
Is that the radio
Yes that's the radio
Catch the sound, catch the sound, catch the sound
Boogie, street boogie
Boogie, street boogie
You said you'd never fake it
You swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real
And I fell into your love trap
Lying, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word
And it never occurred to me
Is this a game are you just playing
Will I be losing you
Oh am I a victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only using me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me
My friends warned me about you
I laughed, how could I doubt your love
Then I saw you with him
And my world crumbled around me
I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me
Where my heart used to be
So now, this was a game you were just playing
And now I'm losing you
Oh I'm a victim of love, victim of love
Well you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Well I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
You were only using me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you've made of me
Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please"
In the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom, do the papers say anything good.
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods"
Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback
The honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning
For cheap easy meals and hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb
Snow, cement and ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters
Tracking down the hours
But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
`Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
`Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no no no
Junk, angel, this closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription
For a brand new heart attack
But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied
I'm going on the circuit, I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song boys to stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney
Oh could you knock a line or two together for a friend
Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
Can you help us
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars
I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins
And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
'Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
Are you working
There's a dusty old gutter he's lying in now
He's blind and he's old
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need 
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather
Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
you're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows
Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare of undue concern
He said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember
Can I still shoot a fast cue
Has this country kid still got his soul
When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor
And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye bye
I never realized the passing hours of evening showers
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
And I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone
I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner, in the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck
Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims
And the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest
Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so, ain't that so
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news
Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street
'Cause the steams in the boiler the coals in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died
Is there anything left
Maybe steak and eggs
Waking up to washing up
Making up your bed
Lazy days my razor blade
Could use a better edge
It's enough to make you laugh
Relax in a nice cool bath
Inspiration for navigation
Of our new found craft
I know you and you know me
It's always half and half
And we were oh oh, so you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear
We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two
Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough to see it through
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure `cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile
I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song, my joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field no longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again
Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had
A once upon a time
Yell help, too many cooks and a bird in the bush, yell help
Yell help, if your mirror busts and your cat gets cussed, yell help
'Cause down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you find another sweet lady cooking
So I gotta yell help
Yell help, some shelter from the storm like the travel agent warned
Yell help, if you can help your superstitions they gonna keep you warm
'Cause down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you seen another sweet lady cooking
So I gotta yell help
I wish tonight wasn't Wednesday night
I wish it wasn't the thirteenth of July, yell help
And you're looking at the guy whose eyes can't deny
That he wishes he were somewhere else tonight
Well I met this woman down in New Orleans
Lord she built just like a dream
Even wore stockings that had seams
And she was ugly
Now hell I don't mind women of her kind
I'll even pay sometimes for a woman that's ugly
She built like a steamroller
Just the kind to mow you over anytime
Hey the moment might arrive
On bourbon street
Well the ugliest woman you'll ever meet
But she's mine all mine and she's ugly
So I better yell help
Can you tell me how old Dan might have done it
If he'd been here now, holy cow
My stars might have been read on the planet Mars
Because I don't have foresight to see
If we still be together in the twenty first
In the twenty first century
He's our flying ace, pilot of the future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size
Because I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny
So long captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye restless night
You know I loved Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long
Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it
He doesn't know it
But I liked the Meko
I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey so sweet
Down where Lexington cross 47th Street
She's a big girl, she's standing six foot three
Turning tricks for the dudes in the big city
Island girl
What you wanting with the white man's world
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from the racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wanting with the white man's world
She's black as coal but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake
He one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake
Yeah I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed that I was still alive
I couldn't understand it
I thought I died last night
Oh I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance
Just to dig the local sounds
When along came a señorita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me my the arm
And he said grow some funk of your own amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
Well I looked for support from the rest of my friends
For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten
I knelt to pray
Just to see if he would comprehend
Like a corn in a field I cut you down
I threw the last punch too hard
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found
I knew then I had lost what should have been found
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford
Like a child when his toy's been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law
They must have had the whole thing planned
There must have been a hundred
If we make a stand
I think we'll be outnumbered
If I'd had the chance
Then I could understand
Why I'm a juvenile delinquent
In an East End gang
And if you think you've seen gasoline burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be, it's good to be alive
It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around
I've been bottled and been brained
Squealers can't be trusted
If we fight tonight
You can bet we'll all be busted
I'd like to break away
From the rut I'm in
But beggars can't be choosers
And I was born to sin
Let's hear it for the street kids
Making news just being around
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Staring at the same four walls
Waiting for the working day to end
Then I get home so wasted, worn out
I curse at you and tell you
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men
How I've struggled for my money
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah
Well I'm tired of it honey
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while
All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife
I never seem to look at you
And see that somewhere underneath
A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long
Let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt
Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives
While I persist I'm putting out the fire
All you hear are hard luck stories
Just a few well chosen words
'Cause you're still the woman of a working man
You've got the heart of a working girl
Don't close the shades
I'm scared of the darkness
I'm cold as a razor blade
Inches from madness
Don't let me sleep here
They're all trying to kill me
I've seen the walls moving
They've all heard me screaming, screaming
Feed me
Feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
`Cause I miss my basement
The sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home
So feed me
Give me my treatment and free me
My arms are so hungry so feed me
The room's so distorted
And filled with mad shadows
I feel like a carcass
White like a marrow bone
It all seems so long ago
I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream
I saw the red light flashing, flashing
Take the wheel I hear the timbers creaking
Take the wheel I think this ship is sinking
Jamaica seems so far and I've been thinking
Old Billy Bones has gone to sea and quit his dockside drinking
Check it out, check it out, check it out
And when I'm dead who'll fly the White Bird home
I'm not the ancient mariner your children know
And the sea's the field these old jack tars have sown
`Cause Billy Bones just wants to know who'll fly the White Bird home
Oh your majesty, your majesty
I heard the bosun cry
Old Billy Bones has washed ashore
Upon a foreign tide
Tonight
Do we have to fight again
Tonight
I just want to go to sleep
Turn out the light
But you want to carry grudges
Nine times out of ten
I see the storm approaching
Long before the rain starts falling
Tonight
Does it have to be the old thing
Tonight
It's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise
And place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
And I cannot find the time
Tonight
Just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight
Why not approach with less defiance
The man who'd love to see you smile
Who'd love to see you smile
Tonight
Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
'Cause progress here don't move with modern times
There's nothing to steal
So there's not a great deal of crime
It sure is hell living in a one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair just picking a tune
And they ain't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
But if you want to hear Susanna then they'll pick all night
They'll pick all night
'Cause it's no dice living in a one horse town
Laid back, as my old coon hound
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
There's nothing to steal `cause there's simply nothing much around
Sure is hell living in this one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
There's nothing to steal `cause there's nothing much around
The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise to see you very much alive
In the English rain again
And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it
Oh, Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
You're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child
I remember still those lazy summer days
We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers
Crime in the streets
I read about it everyday in the papers
Justice needs and justice wants
But just in times, yes, too late here
Feels like I wasn't born there
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim
Boogie Pilgrim
Hustled to get it
To get it together
Down on the jive talk
Down on the weather
Boogie Pilgrim
Brother I never felt better
No, I never felt better
Low life's complete
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)
I got the speed if you got the need
But the need in me needs nothing
(But you know that I need nothing)
But I know that you all want something
Just like Boogie Pilgrim
Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head
The cellophane still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand
As whispers circulate all day
Their back-stage baby princess passed away
And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
'Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies
Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets
Let down before the final curtain
A shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss to the faithful who'd miss her
On a bench, on the beach
Just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you
Plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean
Before light shook the sky
Down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please understand
It's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away
From hungry hands, from hungry hands
Crazy water
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water
Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray
For the souls of missing whalers
Endless nights on an endless sea
Where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean
Separating you and me
Separating you and me
Now it was just like Frankie and Johnny
And it was just like Stagger Lee
Dolly Summers was a simple girl
From a mid-west family
With a stucco home and her own Mustang
And a charge account at Sears
She had everything that a girl could want
To live happy for the rest of her years
But the thing that she wanted most of all
Was the thing that she had lost
To the arms of a downtown black jack hustler
By the name of Candyfloss
They'd slipped town on a late night train
Heading for the West
Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her Mustang
With a piece between her breast
If it seemed just like a movie
Or a night of bad TV
They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
As she drove across the country
With daggers drawn for her fallen man
An venom in her heart
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
Making out in a picnic park
But the thing that shook her rigid
As she fumbled for her gun
Was the state of the man that she'd married once
And thought of as the only one
And as she looked back on the chances
That she'd passed up at home
Well she quietly dumped pistol in a ditch
And she headed home alone
What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there
What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word
It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
What do I do to make you love me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me
What have I got to do
What have I got to do
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead
I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen
So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay
And if I shower around 3 a.m.
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen
Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when its sinking
I never condemned you, I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a King
For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season
Erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tealeaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind
And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed
Gone is a word that I now rarely use
Though sometime in the course of a day
I go racing back like a man possessed
By the wide-eyed and laughing daughters of some different age
He died when the house was empty
When the maid had gone
He put a pen to paper for one final song
He wrote -
Oh babe, it's the only way
I know it's wrong but I can't stand
To go on living, to go on living, living life this way
And I don't know what the time is
Or what the next line is
Or how you're going to take the news
But if I had my life again
I wouldn't change a thing
I'd let nobody, I'd let nobody
Stand inside my shoes
Something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be
I've gathered dust like the dying flowers
And I've drunk myself sober
After hours and hours
After hours and hours
She grows, she's grown like pampas
Tall in the wind
She's sinful and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children
And she's been my lover
No no no no no no she don't like to fight it
Once you've been bitten
You get excited
My mama she really likes her
She comes for coffee
And my mama asked me
So where's the shoorah she sang
You know I hear it again my friend
Where's the shoorah she came upon it
Waiting to sing her back
'Cause she likes to sing about
Where's the shoorah she sang
Over and over and over
Where's the shoorah she sang
Torn from their families
Mothers go hungry
To feed their children
But children go hungry
There's so many big men
They're out making millions
When poverty's profits
Just blame the children
If there's a God in heaven
What's he waiting for
If He can't hear the children
Then he must see the war
But it seems to me
That he leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land
Dying for causes
They don't understand
We've been taking their futures
Right out of their hands
They need the handouts
To hold back the tears
There's so many crying
But so few that hear
If there's a God in heaven
Well, what's he waiting for
If there's a God in heaven
What's he waiting for
He was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn, born uneven
A classless creature, a man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him
To the very bottom
Because they made him and they'll waste him
And I don't believe that I want to watch them
'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then, now he's an idol here
But his face has changed, he's not the same no more
And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before
He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized in the wallet size
The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend that it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts from the lion's share
She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Don't let me down
Please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Strobe light on the funky feet
Soul children in the disco heat
Top dog, top cat
Move that muscle and shake that fat
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Chicago, L.A.
Every place, every way
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Strobe light on the funky feet
The soul children in the disco heat
Top dog, top cat
Move that muscle and shake that fat
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Illinois, Santa Fe
Do what I say
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Oh my love
I have cursed the stars above
That lead my heart to you
But as hard as I try
Still my love will not die
And the stars still shine on through
And the stars still shine on through
Oh my dear
Now this ship's too hard to steer
The tide has turned, turned on you
I have been through the lies
That I've seen in your eyes
But the truth still shines on through
But the truth it still shines, shines on through
So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Though we took our love so daringly
And gave it up uncaringly
There are feelings left not even we can kill
Oh my friend
So at last we reach the end
The lights go down on cue
I have wasted my time
But it tasted oh so fine
That my love still shines, shines on through
And my love still shines, shines on you
It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
There's nothing to fear and so much to be
But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
That homeland of mine is beginning to call
Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
Fading dreams grow cold as ice
And I got a feeling we will meet again
When we return to paradise
The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
There's no need for tears and no time for lies
So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
Remember me while we are apart
I'm heading homeward
Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
But we'll return to paradise again
I got feet sticking out of my shoes
I got heat more than I can use
I got love, I got all I need
I got soles that are wearing thin
I got holes where the rain gets in
I got you and that's enough for me
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, long as I got your love
Clothes that are falling apart
I got a car that refuses to start
I got love, I do the best I can
I got bills piling up in the hall
I got paint peeling off the wall
I got you, I'm a happy man
Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours
So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks
He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more
Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper
And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours
Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper
It ain't gonna be easy from now on
You've been messing around while I've been gone
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind
It ain't gonna be easy I can tell
Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out honey you're playing with my heart
It ain't gonna be easy that's for sure
Changing things back the way they were before
Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
It ain't easy to put it back again
It ain't gonna be easy to forget
You've been seeing a man that I ain't met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out baby, you're playing with my heart
It ain't gonna be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You gotta play your cards or fold a losing hand
And it ain't gonna be easy that's no lie
But if you're willing to try it so am I
It ain't gonna be so easy from the start
You better look out darling, you're playing with my heart
Part time love is bringing me down
'Cause I just can't get started with you my love
Did I hear you saying that I'm too hard hearted
Wipe those stars from your eyes
And you'll get quite a surprise
Because you'll see everybody's got a part time love
You've been seen running around
There's not much I don't hear of and still you try
Telling me all the things I must stay clear of
Don't tell me what to do
When you been doing it too
Because you, me and everybody's got a part time love
Falling, I'm falling can't get free
Baby if you keep on stalling
Oh how can I make you see
That you, me and everybody needs a part time love
Part time love
I seem to be pulling in the wrong direction
With you my love
Whatever I do you raise the same objection
I've got someone at home
But she's got a love of her own
Because you, me and everybody got a part time love
I'm waiting, I'm waiting all the time
And it's getting so frustrating
Love well it ain't no crime
Because you, me and everybody needs a part time love
And oh you, me and everybody's got a part time love
And oh you, me and everybody needs a part time love
You, me, everybody got a part time love
When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still ain't quite enough
Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone
When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A.
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest
Talking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before they're gone
Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I die
I'm still in love with you oh shooting star
And when I start to wonder where you are
There you are, there you are, shooting star
You may have seen me at the early show
I sat and watched you from the second row
Oh you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far oh shooting star
And with the spotlight shining in your eyes
It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might
Think of me, shooting star
And when that moment comes at last
And you remember who you are
Here I'll be, shooting star, shooting star
Here I'll be, shooting star, shooting star, shooting star
The fuse is set and checked once more
Then left beside a back street door
And in the cold grey light
Someone sees a shadow run through the night and out of sight
They hide inside a smoke filled room
To hear at last the blast of doom
And so the deed is done
They listen to the final countdown begun, three, two, one
Madness, it's a kind of madness
Tat turns good men bad
And we're helpless caught up in the madness
Of a world gone mad
The roar of fire rings out on high
And flames light up the black night sky
A child screams out in fear
A hopeless cry for help but no one is near enough to hear
As walls collapse and timbers flare
The smell of death hangs in the air
When help at last arrives
They try to fight the flame but nothing survives of all those lives
And it's madness, every time a victim dies
There is madness, burning in a blind man's eyes
And it's madness, hidden in the hate and pain
There is madness, burning in a wild man's brain
And it's madness, every time the bullets start
There is madness, burning in a poor man's heart
And it's madness, something that we can't control
There is madness, burning in a madman's soul
Madness
Life
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life...
