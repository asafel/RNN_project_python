    "This was a very intensive project and we learn a lot!\n",
    "We had to learn a new language (python) and combine all the tools we acquired in the class within it.\n",
    "As we mentioned before, we wanted to test and see if a neuron network can learn sentence from songs specifically Elton Joan songs which we really love.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the similarity index in our result was not higher only 0.0009, but this can be explained by the following reasons.\n",
    "We conclude that the reason behind it is because we didn't run the RNN with a lot of iterations. You can see in the code above that the variable \"NEPOCH\" equals only 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning we tried to run the RNN while the variable \"NEPOCH\" equals to 5 and to 10 until we stopped at 20. We saw that as this variable is getting bigger the similarity index is getting higher and we receive better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we didnâ€™t run the RNN with a lot of iterations (higher than 20) was mainly hardware. Our computer are not strong enough and several time we had blue screens and the CPU was sky rocketing. (It was steady on 98-100% even with only 20 runs and it took a lot of time also).\n",
    "The hardware in the university were even lower than our computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue was the graphic card drivers. Using THEANO the right way meaning using GPU but we couldn't do it. we tried several drivers but nothing change still the CPU utilization was quite high.\n",
    "This is a common problem with this package and after reading a lot online we figure out our graphic cards aren't suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way we try to receive a better results was by running the code in amazon but it didn't work. The configuration was a mess and we lack the experience working with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned that a change in the size of the vocabulary does effect the results we get and the similarity index. Although we had poor result, the limited size of the vocabulary (about 5000 words) gives us mitigated performance. \n",
    "We had to limit the size of words in order to have a better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that as the size of the vocabulary get bigger, the time to learn is growing and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that another reason for the poor results is the data we created - we focused on lines from songs. Each line in the CSV file represent a line from a song, but this is not a homogeneous data.\n",
    "Is it safe to assume that lines of a song by the same song writer have the same context?\n",
    "Well after seeing the result the answer might be NO. \n",
    "But maybe a good way to test it further is to try finding similarity by those method which we thought about:\n",
    "1. Test songs within the same album\n",
    "2. Make each line in the data as a complete song and not only a line from a song which is lack of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was interesting to look at the semantic dependencies of sentences from elton john songs. We enjoyed learning about RNN and machine learning and also creating our own dataset from scratch.   "
